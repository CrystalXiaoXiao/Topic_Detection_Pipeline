So what better way to spread the word about your brand and company than to adorn the signature blue jerseys of the team. BYJU'S reportedly has that much-coveted spot now, replacing electronics brand OPPO.  OPPO had paid Rs 1,079 Cr for the right to be on the jersey in 2017 but now finds the price too high and unsustainable. It's allocating the rights to BYJU'S according to a Times Of India Report, and work on the front is already in progress. OPPO would also pay BYJU'S, a small fee to cover for the expenses of being the sponsor, while the Board for Control of Cricket in India (BCCI) would continue to receive the same amount that OPPO had bid. BYJU'S would hold the rights for the sponsorship till March 2022.  After back-to-back massive funding rounds over the last year, the Bengaluru-based edtech unicorn tripled its revenue to INR 1,430 Cr ($204.36 Mn) in FY18-19. This helped the company turn profitable on a full-year basis.  Interestingly, BYJU'S sponsorship deal comes at a time when the company is looking to expand overseas. Being the sponsor of the Indian cricket team which draws throngs of fans from around the world is the perfect exposure vehicle for BYJU'S as it looks to take on global edtech players.  The company had raised $150 Mn from Qatar's sovereign wealth fund, the Qatar Investment Authority (QIA) earlier this month. BYJU'S said it would use this funding for international expansion and tailoring its product for a global audience. Byju Raveendran, cofounder and CEO, BYJU'S, said, \u201cThis partnership will support and strengthen our vision of creating and delivering personalised learning experiences to students. This will help us explore and leverage our expertise in creating immersive tech-enabled learning programs for students in smaller cities, regions and newer markets.\u201d  Founded in 2008 by Divya Gokulnath and Raveendran, BYJU'S offers a learning app, which was launched in 2015 and has learning programmes for students in classes IV-XII along with courses to help students prepare for competitive exams like JEE, NEET, CAT, IAS, GRE, and GMAT.  BYJU'S was last valued at $ 5Bn and has raised over $819.8 Mn funding from investors such as General Atlantic, Tencent, Naspers, and Canada's Pension Plan Investment Board (CPPIB) among others.","tags":"edtech|TAG|oppo|TAG|byju's","category":"Technology","primary_image_url":"https:\/\/i2.wp.com\/cdn.inc42.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/07\/india-kit-byjus-social.jpg?fit=1200%2C628&ssl=1","primary_image_width":1200,"primary_image_height":628,"secondary_image_url":null,"secondary_image_width":0,"secondary_image_height":0,"publisher":"inc42","publisher_domain":"inc42.com"}

The notification is initially planning to set up 1,000 EV charging stations. These charging stations will be sanctioned to different states\/cities\/entities after evaluation of the received proposals, it added. This investment towards the deployment charging stations is said to be a part of the government's FAME II initiative.  Earlier this month, NITI Aayog had said that the Ministry of Heavy Industry will soon announce incentives related to electric vehicle infrastructure. At that time, NITI Aayog's Anil Srivastava has estimated that the electric vehicle industry needs an investment of $40 Bn on battery capacity over the next three years.  Further, the much-discussed tax cut on electric vehicles is set to be finalised by the GST Council this week. The council was earlier reported to have, by and large, agreed on the tax reduction, despite concerns from some states about the move.  Finance Minister, Nirmala Sitharaman has said in her 2019 budget speech that GST Council will be considering the slashing down of GST on EVs from existing 12% to 5%.  Another new development in the government's ongoing efforts to push green mobility alternatives are the plans of an electric highway pilot.  In his recent address at the Lok Sabha, the Indian minister for road transport and highways, Nitin Gadkari had said that the ministry in association with heavy industries department will run a pilot for the electric highway. This would be set up on a 10Km stretch of the upcoming Delhi-Mumbai expressway, the minister added.

Nilekani has now introduced a new model which could change the game for the fintech ecosystem in India in the form of account aggregator.  Nilekani debuted Sahamati, a collective of account aggregator focussed on fintech data and addressing the friction in accessing this data. The Sahamati framework addresses pain points and provides a digital platform for easy sharing and consumption of data between its partner entities, with user consent.  Sahamati claims that it has in-principle approval from RBI, while other financial services regulators (FSRs) are providing the required regulatory support and guidance for the rollout. Sahamati's data empowerment and protection architecture (DEPA) enables the collection and use of personal data to improve access to financial, healthcare, and other socio-economically important services in real-time. DEPA also claims to preserve the safety, security and privacy of users.  Introduced at a closed user group meet in Mumbai, Sahamati will help individuals and small businesses share their digital financial data with third parties in a secure way and gives them greater control and visibility over how their data is being used.

Innoviti also said that it has been granted an ex-parte ad interim injunction from the Bengaluru High Court effective immediately that will prevent Pine Labs from manufacturing, selling, distributing, advertising, exporting, offering for sale, procuring and dealing with this technology through its 'Plutus Smart' or any other device in India.  \u201cThis transaction-specific dynamic-QR technology enables processing of payments using UPI, Bharat QR and other QR-based payment forms through the same point-of-sale POS devices that are normally used for accepting credit\/debit card payments. Innoviti has already licensed this technology to several partner financial organizations and is currently in discussion with more,\u201d Innoviti said in a statement.  Pine Labs declined to comment to Inc42's queries till the time of publication.  Innoviti has been granted the patent by Indian Patent Office which will hold force till March 29, 2037.  Bengaluru-based Innoviti is backed by marquee investors including Infosys co-founder NR Narayana Murthy's Catamaran Ventures, SBI Ven Capital, Singapore and Bessemer Venture Partners, USA.  \u201cWe were shocked to know about this when one of our employees alerted us about it this month after seeing the technology being used at one of the shops in Bengaluru,\u201d said Rajeev Agrawal, chief executive at Innoviti.  Innoviti said that given several instances of commercial organizations in India being involved in selling and offering for sale payment products that may infringe on Innoviti's patent, it has now begun legal enforcement of its patent rights.  Across India, Innoviti said it processes around $5 billion of payments annually from over 1000 cities. It has filed 16 patent applications in different payment technology areas.  In March, Innoviti raised INR 80 Crs in a funding round led by Trifecta Capital and a clutch of other NBFCs.  Innoviti process' 4.3% of overall retail digital payment transactions in India with around $5 Bn of payments annually from over 1000+ cities.  Pine Labs which is backed by top investors such as Sequoia, PayPal, Temasek and Sofina and had recently acquired gift card solutions provider, Qwikcilver, for $ 110 Mn.  In February, it was reported that Pine Labs was in advanced talks to close a funding round of around $75 Mn from existing investors like Temasek and PayPal that would push the company valuation to $1.2-1.4 billion, up from its previous valuation of $900-950 million, making it a unicorn.  Founded in 1998, Pine Labs raised $125 Mn from Temasek and PayPal last May. Before that, Pine Labs had raised $82 Mn from private equity fund Actis and California-based investment company Altimeter Capital.

DataLabs by Inc42's Indian Tech Startup Funding Report H1 2019 shows that the overall journey in terms of funding has been slow for the year.  In the context of the Indian startup ecosystem, the beginning of the year can be considered quite slow \u2014 the total funding deal count in Q1-2019 was 15.24% lower in comparison to the average quarterly deal count of 210 (2014 to 2018). 557 Investors participated in startup funding and 96 Corporates participated in startup funding, according to DataLabs by Inc42.  With that overview, it should be clear that the investment track in the Indian startup ecosystem had a moderate first half of 2019, similar to H1 2018. As per DataLabs by Inc42 estimates, the total recorded funding in H1 2019 ($5.85 Bn) is 16.64% higher than the median half yearly funding amount of $5.01 Bn (2014 to H1 2019). But as seen in a Y-o-Y comparison, this is only a slight bump in an otherwise declining trend for funding amount since 2017.  Sequoia Capital India was the most active VC with 23 funding deals. The second spot was bagged by Accel partners registering 17 deals followed by Blume Ventures, Beenext and Matrix Partners.  In retrospect, Sequoia Capital grabbed the top spot in 2016 as well but Accel partners came third. However, in 2017, the latter bagged the first spot, registering 25 deals and Sequoia Capital India, on the other hand, was placed on the third rank with 20 deals.  As the second half of 2019 begins, with impetus from the new Union Budget key highlights, it will be interesting to watch how VC's invest in the Indian startup ecosystem. The government will initiate regulations which will affect taxation, recognition, and promotion of startups.  Here's a brief look at the most active VCs in H1 2019:  Sequoia Capital India  The most active VC in the first half of 2019, Sequoia Capital India specialises in investments across all startup life cycles including seed, early, growth and late stage companies.  The company closed its sixth fund at a fund corpus of $695 Mn in August 2018. Sequoia India said it would look at more investments in early and growth stage startups, targeting technology, consumer and healthcare sectors across India and Southeast Asia. Sequoia has made over 200 investments in India and SEA so far. This includes notable names such as Zilingo, Bira, Mu Sigma, Freshworks, Druva, Freecharge, Pine Labs, and JustDial among others.  In April, it announced the first cohort of Surge accelerator programme, where eight out of the 17 selected startups were from India. The selected Indian startups include Doubtnut, Khatabook, Azani Sport, Bulbul, Flynote, Hippo Video, Skillmatics, and InterviewBit Academy.  Accel Partners  Founded in 1983 has a global presence in Palo Alto, London, New York, China, and India. Typical multi-stage investments in internet technology companies are made by Accel partners.  Accel currently has a $450 Mn India fund with 70% of its investments falling around or below the $2 Mn mark. The VC fund majorly invests in consumer internet, enterprise software, financial technology, business-to-business and healthcare.  Accel entered India in 2008 with the acquisition of Erasmic Venture Fund and has since backed hundreds of companies like BookMyShow, BlackBuck, BlueStone, Flipkart, FreshDesk, Portea, Power2SME, Swiggy, UrbanClap, among others.  Blume Venture Advisors  This VC funds early-stage seed, startups, pre-series A, Series B, and late-stage investments. Blume backs startups with both fundings as well as active mentoring and support.  Blume's portfolio is primarily dominated by B2C firms, including the likes of Cashify, Dunzo, Printo, Unocoin, HelathifyMe, and BEE-Hive workspace. Earlier this month, Blume led the funding round for Mumbai-based healthcare aggregator HealthAssure, which raised $2.5 Mn in Series A funding. In May, Bengaluru-based deeptech startup Agara Labs had raised $2.5 Mn in a pre-Series A funding round from Blume.  Looking at the current trends of 2019, funding in sectors like fintech, media, transport tech is on the rise. These trends and a plethora of other data-driven insights from innovative startup sectors such as online gaming, fintech, transport tech, and deep tech are part of the Inc42 DataLabs' Indian Tech Startup Funding Report Q1 2019.  Indian startups raised over $3.4 Billion across 174 deals in Q1 2019 alone. In the first quarter of 2019, the Indian tech startup ecosystem recorded total funding of $3.42 Bn across 174 deals. Even though that is an increase in absolute terms, it's a mere 5.36% growth from $3.24 Bn recorded in the previous quarter (Q4 2018). Though when seen from a Y-o-Y perspective and compared to Q1 2018, the total funding in Q1 2019 grew by 39% from the recorded $2.46 Bn.","tags":"venture capitalists|TAG|indian tech startup funding report","category":"Technology","primary_image_url":"https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/cdn.inc42.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/07\/VC-h1-social.jpg?fit=1200%2C628&ssl=1","primary_image_width":1200,"primary_image_height":628,"secondary_image_url":null,"secondary_image_width":0,"secondary_image_height":0,"publisher":"inc42","publisher_domain":"inc42.com"}

This is the first Indian government's official report which has discussed blockchain in length and breadth.  The report has not only highlighted the technology, its importance but has also suggested a slew of use cases where blockchain could bring more transparency and efficiency into the system.  Meanwhile, Seattle and Pune-based software company Icertis which is also developing blockchain-based solutions has raised $115 Mn funding and has joined the unicorn club, much earlier than anyone expected.  In another news, Binance Labs, an incubation arm of crypto major Binance has announced plans to host its third season of incubation programme in Asia. This is the first time, Binance Labs will be conducting the incubation programme in Asia. In this weekly roundup, we will also bring the excerpts of our conversation with Ella Zhang, Head of Binance Labs to know more about this.  Icertis Joins SaaS Unicorn Club With $115 Mn In Funding  Seattle and Pune-based software company Icertis has raised $115 Mn in a funding round led by US-based venture capital firm Greycroft and PremjiInvest.  Existing institutional investors including B Capital Group, Cross Creek Advisors, Eight Roads, Ignition Partners, Meritech Capital Partners and PSP Growth also participated in the round. With this round, the company has achieved a valuation above $1 Bn and joins the ranks of SaaS unicorns such as Freshworks and Druva.  The company said it will utilise the capital to strengthen its product, invest in new technologies such as blockchain, artificial intelligence, and machine learning and expand its global footprint. With this round, Icertis has raised over $211 Mn funding.  Icertis has developed Icertis Blockchain Framework which is used by numerous companies including Mercedes-Benz.  Binance Labs' Third Season Will Be Hosted In Asia  After having successfully conducted season 1 and 2 of the incubation programme at San Francisco, Binance Labs, an incubator arm of Malta-headquartered crypto major Binance has decided to host season 3 in Asia.  In the upcoming season, the company is looking to hone in on startups related to BEP 2, gaming, decentralised finance, layer 2 scaling, governance tools and decentralised apps (from Europe\/Asia\/North America), and stablecoins, payments, remittances and trading infrastructures (from Africa\/Latin America\/Southeast Asia).  Speaking to Inc42, Ella Zhang, Head of Binance Lab said,  \u201cWe have incubated eight and 13 startups in Season One and Season Two respectively and are now looking to incubate 20 startups this Season.\u201d  The 10-week programme is expected to run from October to December, this year.  Excerpts from the interview\u2026  Inc42: Why Asia?  Ella: It was based on the feedback we received. The first and second season of incubation programmes attracted a lot of European and North America engineers. They value the Asia community a lot. They wanted us to come to and build up a base in Asia, especially to cater to China, Korea, Southeast Asia and India.  Inc42: Where are you looking to host the programme in Asia?  Ella: This is still under discussion, as we are looking into a number of issues, mainly visa. Different countries have different visa policies. As we are accepting applications from Latin America, Africa, EU, North America as well as Asia, we are looking at the location which has the most entrepreneur-friendly visa policy.  The place could be China, Hong Kong or Singapore.  Inc42: What's your programme structure? Do you fund to the startups as well?  Ella: We have created a programme which I can say similar to Y Combinator. We are looking to incubate projects where blockchain is being used as the underlying technology. The alumni are also helping in mentoring shortlisted entrepreneurs.  We do look into their funding. However, since most of these projects are in super-early stages, funding might take its own time. For the Season Three demo day, we are expecting around 150 investors to join in.  Inc42: Is blockchain overhyped?  Ella: I think, another wave of quality, quantity and technology will get blockchain highly recognized. I personally believe, trading is still the biggest application so far, to warm up the blockchain market and is bringing more believers in blocking good deals. But, in terms of other real applications, we see a lot of potentials.  A slew of projects is trying to solve the current issues through blockchain. I see the most clever and bright brains jumping through this space. Professors, regulators, scientists and hardcore engineers are together building the future of blockchain and crypto. But, there is a lot of challenges as well. I personally believe it will take another 5 to 10 years to make mass adoption happen. So right now, it is still early-stage as believers are trying hard to solve the technology issue and find the real use cases.  CredAble Granted NBFC License By The Reserve Bank Of India  Mumbai-based fintech startup CredAble's wholly-owned subsidiary, Equentia Financial Service Pvt Ltd, has been granted a non-deposit taking Non-Banking Financial Company (NBFC) licence by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI), announced the company in its recent blog post. The startup is currently also looking into blockchain to improve its value proposition for its platform participants.  The company partnered with MonetaGo, to participate on its blockchain platform which prevents double-financing of invoices and mitigates trade finance fraud. CredAble has developed a proprietary Credit Assessment Model, which analyses financial, transactional and company-specific parameters to generate credit scores for prospective borrowers and minimizes the risk of default.  Blockchain Will Significantly Improve International Remittances: Santanu Paul  Speaking at the recently concluded Confederation of Indian Industry's blockchain summit in Hyderabad, NPCI independent director and chairman of Innovation Council, NPCI stated that now international remittances take five days, but with blockchain, the time will be trimmed to 30 seconds and the cost of the transaction will plummet from perhaps $20 currently to a few cents.  \u201cBlockchain is the first technology which man is creating to protect machines from human beings. The database will be tamper-proof. Blockhain is automating trust,\u201d he added.  D Raju, chairman of CII Telangana said, \u201cIn 2019, businesses are expected to spend $2.9 billion on the technology, up almost 90% from 2018, as per International Data Corporation. The global blockchain technology revenues are expected to top $23.3 billion in the next 4-5 years.\u201d  In other news, Singapore-based real-time omnichannel marketing solutions provider Resulticks announced Kulmeet Bawa as company's Chief Operating Officer and President, JAPAC.

Considering its oil (import) bill and choking pollution levels from fossil fuels, India too has steered its policy towards the use of electric vehicles since 2015, with the implementation of the FAME Scheme Phase-I [Faster Adoption and Manufacturing of (Hybrid &) Electric Vehicles in India].  The scheme attempted to incentivise the market and its customers by the reduction in the prices of the EVs and had four focus areas \u2013 technology development, demand creation, pilot projects and charging infrastructure.  NITI Aayog's Electronic Vehicle Policy (May 2017) states that India aims to phase out fossil-fuel-based auto-rickshaws by 2023, scooters and motorcycles (150cc) by 2025 and, by 2030 achieve at least 40% electrification in private transport.  However, according to a Bloomberg New Energy Finance report of March 2017, India has only over 350 public EV chargers, compared with around 57,000 petrol pumps. In comparison, China at the end of 2016 had over 200,000 charging points.  Per se Bloomberg's report, New Energy Finance Long-term Electric Vehicle Outlook 2018, it is anticipated that EVs will represent only 10% of India's total passenger vehicle fleet in 2040 owing to lack of concrete initiatives to promote EV.  In this backdrop, Phase\u2013II of the FAME scheme was launched from April 1, 2019, with an outlay of INR 10K Cr for the next three years, so as to encourage faster adoption of e-vehicles by offering upfront incentive on purchase of e-vehicles (by way of reducing market price) and creating charging infrastructure for EVs.  NITI Aayog's CEO recently professed that India must take the lead in production and consumption of EVs and not become another importing nation. This sector is an important one, and the Government's special attention on it, can be gleaned from para.  112 of the Hon'ble Finance Minister's speech which records \u201cconsidering our large consumer base, we aim to leapfrog and envision India as a global hub of manufacturing of Electric Vehicles.\u201d  Incentivising the sector with a variety of tax-related measures will, hopefully, provide a fillip to this sunrise sector. Tax measures are indeed unique tools in the hands of the policy-makers to direct policy and ultimately the economy onto EVs.  Taxation  In January 2019, Basic Customs Duty (BCD) on various parts and components, imported for manufacture of EVs was reduced.  Proposals in the Union Budget 2019 laid great emphasis on EVs and their future in the Indian context, with incentives and benefits being announced, to promote domestic manufacturing and to boost consumption.  A further exemption from BCD on the importation of certain other parts and components including e-drive assembly, on-board chargers, charging guns, etc. was notified (Notification No. 25\/2019-Cus dated 06.07.2019).  Now, most parts and components required for e-vehicles attract GST at 18% or 28%, whereas sale of an EV itself attracts GST at 12%, resulting in an 'inverted duty structure'. The GST regime has an inbuilt safety valve enabling refunds for such situations, yet it does not fully resolve the situation since 'input services' and 'capital goods', both of which are required for the manufacture of EV, and those which suffer high GST, are ineligible for refund. In effect, there is yet a noticeable cascading impact of taxes for this sector.  The GST Council in June 2019 deferred the decision on reduction of rate of GST (from 12% to 5%), and the matter has been forwarded to the Fitment Committee for its consideration. The reduction in the GST rate from 12% to 5% will increase the gap between effective input tax rate and output tax rate, thereby resulting in higher blockage of funds (working capital), which will have to be claimed as refund from the tax authorities (under the inverted duty structure).  Hence, it may have proved more effective if the GST rate on parts and components was also rationalized, to ease the cash-flow position for manufacturers of EVs and not have them go through the rigmarole of the refund process.  On the direct taxes front, the proposal for additional annual deduction of INR 1.5 Lakh under the Income Tax Act, 1961 towards interest paid on loans taken to purchase EVs will nudge consumption, thereby tying up both the ends viz. demand and supply.  Separately, eligible startups have been given immunity from the angel tax controversy, which will resolve disputes for EV manufacturer startups and benefit them too. In any case, the lower corporate tax rate of 25% extended to companies having turnover below INR 400 Cr will sweeten the deal and attract entrepreneurs to this sector.  In Conclusion  FAME\u2013II aims to create infrastructure needed for charging of EVs while India needs some overhaul of the power (generation and distribution) sector. It is estimated that electricity accounts for approximately 30% of the total costs of operating an EV.  The Government has implemented special EV tariff in October 2018 but, there is a need to further bring down energy costs to make EVs more attractive for customers. It is interesting to note that electricity is not charged to GST, therefore any GST paid on procurements (goods or services) by an electricity company is a cost in the supply chain.  Eliminating cascading effect of GST (enable set-off) in the production\/generation and distribution of electricity will benefit the supply chain and bring down operational costs, so as to benefit and effectively promote, manufacture and sale of EVs in India.  To boost production of energy using cleaner means, it has been proposed in the Union Budget 2019 that schemes will be launched to promote manufacturing of solar photovoltaic cells, lithium storage batteries, and solar electric charging infrastructure by offering investment-linked income tax exemptions under Section 35AD of the Income-tax Act and also grant other indirect tax benefits.  These measures shall aim to harness renewable energy sources to generate and store power. The Finance Minister, with the focus on laying a sturdy foundation for this sector, cut BCD on import of uranium ores and concentrates, which are imported and used for generation of nuclear power, so as to enable increased power generation capacity and at a lower cost.  A sustained effort coupled with stable policy for electricity generation (including by harnessing renewable energy sources rather than conventional sources), will greatly support FAME II, and the Government's present policy.

The investment is part of SoftBank's ambitious Vision Fund 2.  A Wall Street Journal report said that SoftBank's board will meet on Thursday (July 25) in the US to approve the investment.  SoftBank Vision Fund was set up in 2017 with a total corpus of $100Bn. Most of this vision fund was raised from Saudi Arabia and Abu Dhabi. Overall, the company has invested around $10 Bn so far in Indian startups. SoftBank has witnessed an 80% year-on-year growth in its operating income for FY 2019. Son-led company attributed this growth to an unrealised gain of about $12.5 Bn from its investments in ride-hailing company Uber, Indian hospitality company OYO and other portfolio companies.  The conglomerate had recently started raising funds for its second round of Vision Fund. Saudi Arabia and Abu Dhabi are reportedly likely to invest again. However, after a major mess due to Saudi's majority investment in Vision Fund 1, Saudi Arabia is expected to decrease its investment to less than the $45 Bn it contributed last time.  For the new fund, SoftBank has also reportedly received commitments from Standard Chartered PLC, which is expected to invest as debt. The conglomerate is also in touch with Microsoft Corp and several Taiwanese pension and insurance companies for the investment.  The report noted that the company's partners are looking to become an elite member of SoftBank's portfolio club. While Goldman Sachs hopes to get hired on the initial public offerings of the fund's portfolio companies, Standard Chartered is keen to lend to them.  The development comes soon after reports surfaced that SoftBank is planning to launch an initial public offering of its $100 Bn SoftBank Vision Fund. Speaking at SoftBank Group's 39th annual general meeting of shareholders in Tokyo, Masayoshi Son noted that the SoftBank Group's earnings before interest and taxes (EBITDA) has crossed over $18.5 Bn (2 Tn JPY) in FY18. Son attributed this growth to its technology focused investment corpus SoftBank Vision Fund.  He further projected that the firm's portfolio could potentially grow 33-times to reach a $1.8 Tn (200 Tn JPY) valuation in the next two decades.  The conglomerate is also increasing its focus on India as it is reportedly looking to hire a dozen executives in its India operations team over the next few months. The Japanese fund plans to utilise this new team to expand SoftBank's ecosystem connections.","tags":"softbank|TAG|softbank vision fund","category":"Technology","primary_image_url":"https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/cdn.inc42.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/07\/softbank-social.jpg?fit=1200%2C628&ssl=1","primary_image_width":1200,"primary_image_height":628,"secondary_image_url":null,"secondary_image_width":0,"secondary_image_height":0,"publisher":"inc42","publisher_domain":"inc42.com"}

Under this partnership, the blockchain company will provide a hardware car wallet solution, in essence a digital wallet for cryptocurrency, to give the vehicle a network identity that enables it to handle transactions automatically.  The MBP is a decentralised software platform that makes it possible to offer and manage mobility as a service with end-to-end encryption. Its scope of application ranges from the customer journey on the one hand through to fully digitalised contract processing, including the financial posting of the transactions in real time, according to a media statement released by Daimler.  Giving an example, the company noted that one of the product use-case will be a one-click mobility service with fully automated customer verification and transaction processing. In this case.  Further, talking about the use cases for such a car wallet, the RIDDLE&CODE said, \u201cin the future, if users are paying for the journey, they will certainly not want to be bothered with paying separately for all its components such as fuel, parking, tolls, let alone maintenance \u2014 the vehicles wallet will handle that for you.\u201d  Blockchain-powered car wallet solution is said to turn the vehicle into a trusted data source and allowing it to autonomously perform secure transactions between customers, vehicles and other infrastructure, RIDDLE&CODE added.  Blockchain In India  Blockchain industry is going through a regulatory phase in India. Earlier this week, the Inter-Ministerial Committee led by Subhash Chandra Garg, secretary, Department of Economic Affairs (DEA) has recommended the finance ministry to bring a ban on cryptocurrency in India.  The committee recommendations have proposed a complete ban on cryptocurrencies in India either an asset or currency in the country; however, the committee is agnostic about exploring the idea of RBI-backed digital currencies and has welcomed the ongoing innovations happening around blockchain.  While the report is good news for those fighting against the existence and legality of cryptocurrency in India, crypto startups and enthusiasts feel it's a direct violation of Article 19(1)(g) which gives them the fundamental right of freedom to business in any sector or trade. Many of the startup founders and stakeholders were naturally miffed with the decision, and some questioned the logic of the move in their conversations with Inc42.","tags":"daimler ag|TAG|blockchain|TAG|car wallet|TAG|riddle&code","category":"Technology","primary_image_url":"https:\/\/i1.wp.com\/cdn.inc42.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/07\/social-blockchain-car-waller-daimler.jpg?fit=1000%2C700&ssl=1","primary_image_width":1000,"primary_image_height":700,"secondary_image_url":null,"secondary_image_width":0,"secondary_image_height":0,"publisher":"inc42","publisher_domain":"inc42.com"}

It had also barred ecommerce marketplaces from directly or indirectly influencing the cost of a product sold on the platform. Also, ecommerce marketplaces were barred from mandating any seller to exclusively sell on its platform.  In a report to the US government, Walmart stated that India's new FDI in ecommerce policy is regressive and creates an unfair playing field between foreign and domestic enterprises. It also recommended that India extend the deadline for the implementation of its new ecommerce guidelines by a six-month period.

The Inter-Ministerial Committee (IMC) led by Subhash Chandra Garg, former secretary at the Department of Economic Affairs, Ministry of Finance, released the report which spelt doom for cryptocurrency in India.  While we have received some strong counterarguments for the ban from the Indian crypto ecosystem here, Timothy Draper, venture capitalist and founding partner of Draper Fisher Jurvetson (DFJ), Draper Associates, and the founder of Draper Venture Network and Draper University also had a lot to say about the proposed rules.  During an interaction with Inc42, Draper said,  \u201cIt is akin to the Luddites. They are in fact saying, 'we will not tolerate progress.' It will set them back 40 years. Imagine if they did this with the internet?\u201d  In 2014, the billionaire VC had made quite a buzz in the crypto market by purchasing 30K Bitcoin at a premium price of $632 each from US authorities in an auction. Besides investments in Hotmail, Skype, Baidu, Tesla and others, Draper has also invested in a slew of crypto and blockchain startups such as crypto exchange Coinbase, Tezos and Authenteq.  Interestingly, the IMC report has not only proposed a complete ban on cryptocurrencies it has also proposed a jail term of one to 10 years for those who mine, hold, transact or deal with cryptocurrencies in any form, whether directly or indirectly through an exchange or trading. The draft bill also proposes a penalty of up to INR 50 Cr.  And Draper was very critical about this complete ban approach. \u201cPeople will want to leave India to get to a country that is less backward. I suspect they will get out so they can live a better life.\u201d  When Narendra Modi came to power for the second consecutive term, crypto stakeholders in spoke optimistically to Inc42 about their hopes for cryptocurrency in India.  The earlier Dinesh Sharma Committee report in 2017 had suggested a complete ban and also recommended that warnings should be issued to the effect that cryptocurrencies are neither coins nor currencies and consumers should stop trading in these currencies. The ministry of finance constituted another committee on in November 2017 to prepare a draft crypto regulatory framework. That report, out this month, and the attached draft bill, once again refused to recognise the cryptocurrencies either as currency or asset.  \u201cIt seems as though they are clinging to their power instead of thinking of the good of the country. This move shows that Modi has not yet rooted out corruption in the country. It lives on in his own government.\u201d \u2013 Tim Draper  The developments in India have come at a time when many other countries including Russia are considering laws pertaining to cryptocurrency regulations in their country. According to News agency Tass, Russian deputy finance minister Alexei Moiseev told the press, \u201cNow we are looking at the text [of the bill on digital financial assets] and within two weeks, I hope, we will come out for adoption in the second reading.\u201d Moiseyev also told the journalists that the ICO regulation has already been approved.  Meanwhile, Bitcoin, regardless of the news, continues to tumble between $9K and $11K.

The company announced that it had raised external funding for the first time, relinquishing the title of being bootstrapped.  With over 14K corporate clients and around 1.9 Mn users making at least a million transactions daily, the Series C funding round from Sodexo Benefits and Rewards India is indicative of the startup's global ambition, something that Turakhia does not shy away from stating.  \u201cGoing global has always been part of our plans,\u201d Turakhia told Inc42 shortly after the announcement that Zeta had raised money from Sodexo at a $300 Mn valuation.  The initial conversations about an international expansion with external investors had started just over a year ago when Zeta became open to raising external funds and was in touch with a bunch of strategic and financial investors. Of course, Turakhia has been fiercely protecting the equity in Zeta and had pumped in close to $40 mn in funds, along with cofounder Ramki Gaddipati.  As part of those series of conversations with investors, Turakhia had approached Sodexo which was one of its many clients at the time. Sodexo is a household name for many Indian corporate workers as the platform that provides employees with benefits and services. Zeta and Sodexo had been strategic partners since 2017 with the latter helping the France-based company provide employee benefits via card and mobile app to clients. For Zeta, Sodexo's connections in the corporate world, thanks to years of presence in the Indian market, will definitely be a competitive advantage, given how Zeta is looking to disrupt the very space in which Sodexo operates.  Founded in 2015 by Turakhia and Gaddipati, Zeta offers a cloud-native neo-banking platform for the issuance of credit, debit and prepaid products that enable companies to have greater employee engagement through retail and corporate products, besides offering digitised incentives to enterprises such as automated cafeteria billing, employee gifting, recreation and other benefits.  With this funding round, the fintech startup will look at expanding its business to the US, UK, Europe and Southeast Asia. The plan is to start with expanding to 7-8 countries in the next 18 months, before going further. Zeta also plans to use the funding to set up our sales operations in 10 other countries worldwide.  \u201cWe are also in the process of launching a whole suite of other banking products which will enable banks to offer other solutions to their corporate and retail customer base,\u201d said Turakhia.  With Sodexo, Zeta has the advantage of accessing their global reach and in a way already serves Sodexo clients in those regions and will now be looking to target other customers in those geographies.  Zeta currently provides its platform and products to corporate entities in India, Asia, and Latin America. It competes with other enterprise-focused fintech startups like NiYo, which are also working in the same space of corporate engagement and incentives through fintech solutions.","tags":"sodexo|TAG|fintech|TAG|zeta|TAG|bhavin turakhia","category":"Technology","primary_image_url":"https:\/\/i1.wp.com\/cdn.inc42.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/07\/Zeta.jpg?fit=1360%2C1020&ssl=1","primary_image_width":1360,"primary_image_height":1020,"secondary_image_url":null,"secondary_image_width":0,"secondary_image_height":0,"publisher":"inc42","publisher_domain":"inc42.com"}

These days setting up a house seems like a daunting challenge, thanks to demanding work hours and a sense of disorientation in a new city. Bengaluru-based furniture rental platform Furlenco is looking to ease the trouble. Lightbox Ventures-backed Furlenco uses data to analyse user preferences and suggests the kind of interiors and furnishing one should opt for. It even goes a step further to set up an empty house according to the user's taste after getting their consent, before they even move in.  Furlenco came on to the scene when shared economy was just taking off in India back in 2011. Until then the concept of shared furniture was relatively new to India, as ownership was deep-rooted in the minds of consumers. This slowly changed as everything from cars, furniture to workspaces was entering the shared economy.  One of the main reasons for the success of these startups was their use of technology. For any new concept to take off, it is important that the user experience remains smooth and friction free. And this is exactly what Furlenco did in what is largely a touch-and-feel category. The buying experience changed gradually as people became more and more comfortable in renting furniture just by looking at it on their computers or smartphones. In fact, 65% of Furlenco's orders come through its mobile app.  Right from selling, to the customer life cycle, and the end product, Furlenco uses technology \u2014 throughout the user journey. The data that Furlenco leverages helps the startup understand the unique preferences of users and incorporate features that foster a recurring relationship with the customer.  This nuanced use of technology that has led Furlenco to success as furniture rentals have gone up. Today the startup is well on its way to cross INR 100 Cr in revenue and is looking to venture into connected and tech-enabled products for the smart homes of tomorrow.  Furlenco is part of the Inc42 SteppingUp Series, powered by Dell Small Business.

He also acknowledged India's affinity for WhatsApp's easy and simple user interface, and said \u201cI believe it is a very powerful medium and the launch of WhatsApp Payments can prove to be a quantum leap for the digital payments ecosystem in India.\u201d  Stressing on the importance of Indian market for WhatsApp, the NITI Aayog CEO said that out of 1.5 Bn global users of WhatsApp, Indians make for about 400 Mn and in the next four years there will be over a billion WhatsApp users from India.  Further, Amitabh Kant said that unlike the United States where data is owned by Google, and unlike China where it is owned by Alibaba and Baidu \u2014 India has created public entities such as Goods and Services Tax (GST) for tax data, Ayushman Bharat for health data and National Payments Corporation of India (NPCI) which links up 142 banks at the backend and enables digital transactions through UPI mode.  \u201cMy view is that India will be first country to make debit and credit cards redundant. India has built public entities, on the back of which companies can do all innovation,\u201d he added.  In his opening address at the event, WhatsApp global head, Will Cathcart said the company has successfully launched a pilot of WhatsApp Payments on the UPI standard, and will be launching the service for all Indian users, this year.  With regulatory approvals pending for WhatsApp Payments following concerns about data storage and the fake news epidemic on the messaging app, WhatsApp has been having a tough time in India for payments.  The Indian government had stipulated that WhatsApp must comply with Indian norms, including complying with the Reserve Bank of India's data localisation rules, setting up an office in India and appointing a grievance officer and formulate a team in India.  Earlier this month, Inc42 has reported that WhatsApp has resumed the beta test of the WhatsApp Payments services in India, with a select group of users. In June 2018, almost 1 Mn people were testing WhatsApp payments at the beta stage in India.  WhatsApp And NITI Aayog Partnership  Even though finding it slow in complying with the regulatory norms, the government think-tank has today announced a partnership with WhatsApp to promote women entrepreneurship ecosystem in India.  Under this partnership, WhatsApp will announce an annual calendar of events aimed at capacity building of women entrepreneurs and evolve specific programs aimed at addressing challenges being faced by women entrepreneurs. Specifically, this initiative will be focused on the registered users of government-backed women entrepreneurship platform (WEP).  Also, WhatsApp has committed to provide $100K winning amount for Women Transforming India Awards 2019, which is a flagship initiative of NITI Aayog organised in partnership with the United Nations.  Commenting on the partnership, Cathcart said, \u201cSmall businesses are the backbone of a strong economy and I am proud of the role WhatsApp can play in helping to build the next generation of India's women entrepreneurs.\u201d","tags":"women entrepreneurs|TAG|niti aayog|TAG|whatsapp|TAG|whatsapp payments","category":"Technology","primary_image_url":"https:\/\/i2.wp.com\/cdn.inc42.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/07\/social-kant-whatsapp.jpg?fit=1000%2C700&ssl=1","primary_image_width":1000,"primary_image_height":700,"secondary_image_url":null,"secondary_image_width":0,"secondary_image_height":0,"publisher":"inc42","publisher_domain":"inc42.com"}

After Facebook was hit with a massive $5 Bn fine by the US Federal Trade Commission (FTC) for user privacy violations, it's time for the spotlight to shine on another unsavoury aspect of tech companies. The US Department of Justice has announced broad antitrust review into whether major tech companies such as Google, Apple, Amazon, Facebook and others are using their market position to thwart competition through monopolistic practices.  The DOJ's antitrust division said this week that it would scrutinise tech platforms after claims from many experts that the major companies have grown too powerful, owing to near-unlimited resources too big and too powerful.  The DOJ review would reportedly be led by antitrust chief Makan Delrahim, with Google, Apple, Facebook and Amazon being the primary targets given the resources available to these companies. The antitrust division is currently hearing out third parties who have complaints about competitive harm from these companies, according to a Bloomberg report.  It's the latest in a series of legal and political troubles for major tech companies in the US. Facebook has been under fire for nearly two years over its role in meddling with the US presidential elections in 2016. Since then the Mark Zuckerberg-led company has had to undergo investigations, public hearings and bore the brunt of many public domain debates on the pitfalls of social media. The company has tried to make changes in the way user data will be handled in the context of political ads and other targetting, but the criticism for Facebook is louder than ever before.  The DOJ investigation will look at whether tech companies have achieved market power through harmful means, and whether their operations have \u201creduced competition, stifled innovation, or otherwise harmed consumers\u201d, according to a Reuters report.  Tech Giants Turn Public Enemies In The US  For Amazon, the voices in protest, seem to be calling for swifter action on workplace conditions, pay inequality and other labour-related issues. The fact that founder and CEO Jeff Bezos continues to extend his lead as the richest person in the world, even as workers go on agitation over minimum pay issues, has not helped Amazon's efforts to unsully its public image.  Google has had its own set of problems too, ranging from its work with China on the censored search engine and questions about tracking users without consent. Additionally, the company has had to publicly deal with internal issues such as political discrimination and suppression of sexual harassment cases against top management.  Twitter, another tech giant, is also under attack from the conservative political class over the so-called bias against conservative voices, while the liberal political class in the US has come down hard on Twitter over the space given to racist and hate-filled tweets from the likes of US president Donald Trump.  While the protest from the conservatives in the US is well-known, tech companies have also been attacked by the US liberal political class and many left-wing commentators about their stranglehold on the public imagination, their unlimited reach in the internet ecosystem as well as their practices around data and user privacy.","tags":"facebook|TAG|amazon|TAG|google|TAG|apple","category":"Technology","primary_image_url":"https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/cdn.inc42.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/07\/doj-social.jpg?fit=1200%2C628&ssl=1","primary_image_width":1200,"primary_image_height":628,"secondary_image_url":null,"secondary_image_width":0,"secondary_image_height":0,"publisher":"inc42","publisher_domain":"inc42.com"}

WhatsApp Payments Finally Ready For India Launch This Year","pub_feed_url":"https:\/\/inc42.com\/feed\/","destination_url":"https:\/\/inc42.com\/buzz\/whatsapp-payments-finally-ready-for-india-launch-this-year\/","text":"In his maiden visit to India, WhatsApp global head Will Cathcart has said that the company is eager to launch its payments services in the country.  To be noted, Will Cathcart, VP of WhatsApp, is on a visit to India and has been attending multiple events across Delhi and Mumbai. During his visit, Cathcart was reportedly looking to appraise officials of the Reserve Bank of India and the National Payments Corporation of India on steps taken by the company to meet data localisation norms for its planned payment service.  Today (July 25), Cathcart said, \u201cWe are excited to have launched a successful pilot of WhatsApp payments on the UPI standard and we are looking forward to expanding it. Payments services are critical to accelerating financial inclusion and bringing millions more people into India's fast-growing digital economy. We can't wait to provide this service to our users across India this year.\u201d  At the event in Delhi, he also met NITI Aayog chief Amitabh Kant. Addressing the gathering, Kant said that WhatsApp has been very slow in fulfilling the regulatory commitments required for the launch of WhatsApp Payments in India.  Kant also reiterated that they are looking forward to WhatsApp Payments in the country as India contributes 400 Mn of its 1.5 Bn user base across the world.  The Glitches Ahead Of WhatsApp Payments Launch  WhatsApp's first tussle with the Indian government started as a side effect of its parent entity Facebook's massive data breach scandal with Cambridge Analytica, which broke last year. Then the company itself was involved in a fake news epidemic when misinformation and rumours led to a spate of lynchings in 2018 across Assam, Maharashtra, Karnataka, Tripura, and West Bengal. Since then, the company has been taking measures against the spread of fake news on its platform.  The Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology (MeitY) was also asking WhatsApp to devise a technological solution to trace the origin of incendiary messages circulated on its platform. The company had denied the ministry's directions stating that it would not compromise with its encryption process.  In a new step towards importance of privacy, WhatsApp has now announced a partnership with Indian School of Public Policy (ISPP) to organise design workshops for ISPP students. The partnership will bring a series of day-long design workshops or 'design jams' as ISPP likes to put it starting with the first workshop on September 17. It will explore the importance and practice of privacy-centric design to help technology make an impact on the society.  In terms of the WhatsApp payments, which was expected to be launched in May 2018, the plan got stuck with the requirements of data localisation.The Indian government had stipulated that WhatsApp must comply with Indian norms, including complying with the Reserve Bank of India's data localisation rules, setting up an office in India and appoint a grievance officer and form a team in India.  The company has now fulfilled all requirements and had recently resumed beta testing for select users. Recently, the company was speculated to submit its third-party audit report to the RBI and take a step forward for the launch of WhatsApp payments.  Disruption For Paytm, PhonePe And GPay  According to the data released by National Payments Corporation of India (NPCI), Unified Payments Interface (UPI) clocked in 754.54 Mn transactions in June 2019 worth INR 146566.35 Cr. Today, the leading players in the digital payments industry are Google Pay, Paytm and PhonePe.  In May, Google Pay recorded more than 240 Mn transactions taking the leading position in UPI transactions volume for last month. Further, Flipkart-owned PhonePe took the second position after recording 230 Mn UPI payments last month, while Paytm clocked in 200 Mn transactions.  In terms of the value of transactions, the money transferred via Google Pay was the highest at INR 55K Cr, followed by PhonePe at nearly INR 44K Cr and around INR 38.2K Cr using Paytm.  According to NITI Aayog's \u201cDigital Payments (2018 edition)\u201d, India's digital payments industry is estimated to grow to $1 Tn by 2023. It also suggested that the value of digital payments will likely jump from the current 10% to over 25% by 2023.  With the instant outreach of WhatsApp with its 400 Mn users versus the existing players which have worked hard to reach users today, the launch of WhatsApp payments could unsettle the market once more.","tags":"whatsapp|TAG|whatsapp payments","category":"Technology","primary_image_url":"https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/cdn.inc42.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/07\/whatsapp-social-3.jpg?fit=1200%2C628&ssl=1","primary_image_width":1200,"primary_image_height":628,"secondary_image_url":null,"secondary_image_width":0,"secondary_image_height":0,"publisher":"inc42","publisher_domain":"inc42.com"}

The company has formed a new entity \u2014 CARS24 Financial Services \u2014 for the same.  The company will be launching its services in Delhi, Mumbai and Bengaluru in August 2019 and will scale up to the other cities gradually. With the NBFC license, the company aims to provide seamless and instant access to credit.  Founded in 2015 by Vikram Chopra, Gajendra Jangid, Ruchit Agarwal and Mehul Agrawal, Cars24 claims to create an efficient and reliable way for car owners to sell their used cars at the best price. All one has to do is book an appointment with any of the Cars24 branches, visit the branch and sell a car in a single visit.  With Cars24 Financial Services, the company will facilitate vehicle loans to customers as well as finance channel partners to help them expand their businesses. The customers will be eligible for a credit based on the car value they are buying. For consumers, the average ticket size of a loan would be INR 2.5 Lakh- INR 3 Lakh.  Further, channel partners will be eligible to a credit as high as INR 1Cr depending upon their requirement.  Vikram Chopra, cofounder and CEO, CARS24 said, \u201cWith less than 15% penetration of financing in the used cars segment, we feel that there is a massive market opportunity that can be tapped under the financing sector. We are delighted with this progress and intend to set a benchmark for a delightful customer experience on our platform with our new offering.\u201d  The company is planning to hire over 200 people for the business and is targeting loan disbursement worth $25 Mn within the maiden year of its launch.  The company will offer financing at competitive interest rates based on the credit worthiness of the consumers. It will also allow consumers to sell their cars to Cars24 at any time in the future to pay back the loan.  \u201cWith our lower turn-around-time for credit as compared to other banks, we believe that our consumer lending business will benefit both our customers as well as channel partners. The idea is to help those buyers who have been unable to fulfill their dream of owning a car due to lack of funds and support from traditional institutions and banks,\u201d said Ruchit Agarwal, cofounder and CFO, Cars24.  The development comes soon after reports surfaced that Cars24 has shut down about a dozen outlets in Delhi. It had reportedly received nearly six legal notices from landlords in Delhi for non-payment of rent for months. They have alleged that the company then shut down the stores at various places in \u201cviolations\u201d of the lease agreements.  The company intends to scale up its presence in over 300 Tier 2,3 and 4 markets by 2021. Till date, the company has raised $100 Mn from investors such as Sequoia Capital, FCI Fund and KCK Global.  Other major online used car marketplaces in India are CarDekho, Droom, Quikr, Olx, Mahindra First Choice Wheels, among others. According to an IBEF report, the Indian auto industry, one of the largest in the world, accounts for 7.1% of the country's GDP.","tags":"nbfc|TAG|cars24","category":"Technology","primary_image_url":"https:\/\/i1.wp.com\/cdn.inc42.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/07\/cars24-social-1.jpg?fit=1200%2C628&ssl=1","primary_image_width":1200,"primary_image_height":628,"secondary_image_url":null,"secondary_image_width":0,"secondary_image_height":0,"publisher":"inc42","publisher_domain":"inc42.com"}

With this allotment, total debentures issued by Quikr have amounted to INR 80.68 Cr ($11.7 Mn) with secured loans of INR 125 Cr.  The company had received INR 13.9 Cr in a capital infusion from its Mauritius-based entity in May. At the time Quikr issued 14,940 equity shares at a premium of INR 9,300 at a nominal value of INR 100 to Quikr Mauritius Holding Ltd.

Since then, the company has extended its verticals slowly and steadily. With 30 Mn monthly unique visitors, it is currently present in 1,200 cities in India.  The company has been following an acquisition-led strategy to enhance its growth and has acquired over 15 startups, the latest being Bengaluru-based used goods marketplace Zefo, for INR 200 Cr ($28.51 Mn).  Quikr has spread its verticals across diverse domains like grocery, home rentals, beauty services as well as online recruitment.

Further, it was aiming to achieve breakeven in a year's time.  However, last year wasn't all too well for the company. In April 2018, Swedish investor AB Kinnevik marked down the valuation of online classifieds platform Quikr by 12% to $884.94 Mn in its annual report 2017. The valuation of Kinnevik's shares in Quikr is based on the value implied by cash transactions made in secondary Quikr shares with various preferential rights and can be attributed to the currency fluctuation.  Quikr currently competes with other major players such as 99acres.com, Housing.com, Proptiger.com, Square Yards, OLX, oodle, OfferUp and Clickin among others.  A Zinnov report had stated that online resellers space has been predicted to grow to $48 Bn-$60 Bn by 2022.

Recently, there were speculations that Paytm is reportedly in talks to acquire Coverfox for $100-120 Mn in an all-cash deal. According to the report, if successful, Paytm will position itself as one of the largest competitors for insurance marketplace PolicyBazaar.

Unlike its peers Amazon and Walmart who dominate with their sheer market size and number of users, the US-based ecommerce marketplace is not your average ecommerce company.  For those unfamiliar with the brand, Etsy is a marketplace dedicated entirely for handcrafted or handmade goods and products. But its entry in India was partial as it focussed primarily on getting Indian sellers and artisans to cater to its 39.4 Mn active buyers worldwide.  A year into the journey, Inc42 caught up with Himanshu Wardhan, MD of Etsy India to understand the strategy for the Indian market and how it has translated on the ground.  While some Indian sellers have been on Etsy's platform since 2013, the company has seen a remarkable increase in the number of sellers from the country since it began its custom onboarding program which is unlike anything it does elsewhere on the globe. While Wardhan does not reveal the Indian seller headcount, he does disclose that the company has seen more than 110% increase in the number of active sellers when compared with 2017 and the number of new sellers has gone up by 135% with active listings increasing by 95% in the same time period.  This is not at all surprising given the vibrant handicraft industry in the country, which makes up a significant portion of the MSME sector. \u201cUnder the banner of 'Etsy Collective', we are doing workshops throughout India where we engage with sellers and buyers to set up their line of business and handhold them through multiple stages of the online selling journey,\u201d said Wardhan.  The idea behind this move is to help the sellers with things like content, customer success and is not entirely focussed around just setting up shop.  Wardhan told Inc42 that one of the selling points for products that Etsy would like to promote is the story of the makers. \u201cIndia is the only market where we have onboarding sales associates (in seven states) who meet with you and help you set up shop,\u201d said Wardhan.  To further incentivise sellers Etsy doesn't charge for any of the above services and offers 20 free listings on its platform for four months.  The company makes its money by charging 20 cents per product (INR 14-15) for four months listing and charges 5% of the transaction fee.  To give you an idea, a typical seller would not sell too many products and we have thousands of sellers from India who have posted a total of 1.5 Mn product listings from India- Himanshu Wardhan, MD of Etsy India  Etsy's Focus On Women To Grow The Seller Base  One of the biggest differentiators for Etsy when it comes to its seller base, compared to other marketplaces, is that more than 80% of them are women. And in India, where women make a small proportion of the total workforce, that number is indeed surprising.  \u201cWhen I started building Etsy in India, I too had the same question (whether Etsy can focus on women sellers) and we are seeing a very large majority of participation form women,\u201d said Wardhan.  Etsy Collective workshops are seeing overwhelming participation from women along with a few numbers of men and Wardhan believes this is also being translated into the number of sellers.  \u201cThe products that do well on Etsy are jewellery, home decor, apparel and most of the buyers and sellers tend to be women. Once we made the policy clear that we do not want traders or resellers, a lot of businessmen got eliminated,\u201d said Wardhan.  An example that Wardhan mentions is that of Ruchi Pugalia from Lucknow. After a successful but demanding career, Pugalia pursued her passion for fabric and started to make dresses for expecting mothers under the banner 'Comfy Mommy' and has sold over 11K customized maternity gowns on Etsy with most of her customers coming from the US and Europe.  Etsy's India Opportunity  Ecommerce is expected to fuel the next level of Indian consumer growth and is projected to reach $200 Bn in value by 2019. According to a Deloitte India and Retailers Association of India (RAI) report, the ecommerce market is projected to grow to $1.2 Tn by 2021.  In its most recent quarter, Etsy's revenue rose 40% to $169.3 Mn, while gross merchandise sales, or the value of what was sold on the site, rose 18.9% to pass the $1 Bn mark in a strong performance.  While the growth story has been eased by some of that revenue surge, the big challenge for ecommerce platforms without the massive inventory of SKUs and scale of something like Amazon or Flipkart, is to hold on to its customer base or create repeat users. Etsy is also striving to get more repeat orders; 60% of its buyers shopped only once during the last year.  The company is also trying to broaden its customer base in India in the hope of getting more signed-up users to drive repeat orders. Of course, a more diverse product catalogue will form a big part of the success factor in this goal. And that's where Etsy could fall back on the large percentage of sellers who are women. This could be the niche that sets Etsy apart in the Indian context.  When it comes to sellers, Etsy categorises them into three brackets-  Professional designers and artists with training and an existing business offline or online  Homemakers, hobbyists and enthusiasts (predominantly in urban areas)  Traditional artisans who have been practising regional art forms  While the workshops are designed to attract the first two brackets, the company is building its outreach program into the grassroots although it isn't clear if this is something that it would like to do on a scale. The big market is the second category, which should ideally deliver the seller growth for those repeat orders .  For now, Etsy is rolling out photography enablement workshops in states such as Odisha which it plans to expand to a few other states. The company also had multiple discussions with state governments to get access to the data around traditional sellers and artisans, and also to set up skilling workshops for those who are interested in entering the field.  These days the discussion around ecommerce businesses invariably leads to the ongoing tussle between the ecommerce companies and the Indian government over the draft ecommerce policy, which includes discounting, seller agreements and data around ecommerce transactions. Since it's only focussing on sellers, Etsy is one of the few ecommerce companies that at the moment has no qualms with the government. Wardhan added that the company has had discussions with the ministry of commerce and industry to make it easier for Etsy sellers to reach international buyers and become exporters.  That's a crucial point given Etsy's current state of affairs in India. In the Indian market, Etsy is largely focussing on seller growth. In the past, it has been non-committal about tightening the focus around buyers in the Indian market, but Wardhan was more forthcoming about how the company views Indian buyers.  \u201cWe are definitely considering India as a buyer market in the near future. I do feel that there is an opportunity for a player like Etsy given how buyers and consumers have changed. We are trying to redefine how ecommerce is in India away from the deep discounting model which cannot be sustained for a long time,\u201d said Wardhan.  Etsy certainly makes for an interesting player in a segment that has fast become a duopoly and with smaller sellers often finding themselves dwarfed on big platforms. By playing a role in bringing in the new government regulations, the trader, merchant and seller bodies have managed to score a win for the likes of Etsy. And Etsy may find that the time is right to double its bet on India.","tags":"b2c ecommerce|TAG|etsy","category":"Technology","primary_image_url":"https:\/\/i1.wp.com\/cdn.inc42.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/07\/Etsy.jpg?fit=1360%2C1020&ssl=1","primary_image_width":1360,"primary_image_height":1020,"secondary_image_url":null,"secondary_image_width":0,"secondary_image_height":0,"publisher":"inc42","publisher_domain":"inc42.com"}

The concerns of Indian government revolves around the fact that these Chinese ecommerce players such as Shein, Club Factory have been importing goods to India under the garb of gifts and thus, evading the customs duty. Free samples as well as gifts from overseas persons up to the value of INR 5,000 can be received duty-free in India via couriers. However, there is no limit on the number of gifts an individual can receive.  Customs officials at the courier terminals in Bengaluru and Delhi had started to stop clearing parcels shipped under the CB-12 (gift and samples) route. Such parcels were being earlier stopped in Mumbai and now even the customs authority at Chennai ports is considering a similar action.  In June, Mumbai customs officials seized about 500 packages belonging to customers of Shein, and another Chinese etailer Club Factory. The government has begun a review of customs norms governing gifts and is of the view that a tighter framework is needed.  Now, the government is reportedly exploring taxes for buyers at the payment stage to dissuade such orders. The government is looking to bring in payment gateways on board for the plan and when the consumer pays the money, IGST and customs duty will be included in the price.  Prior to this, the government was looking to put a cap on the number of overseas gifts can be enforced by linking receipts to a citizen's Aadhaar or passport number. With the continued actions, Shein had to put a temporary hold its operations in India. The major reason for the lull in sales and the delivery issues was the crackdown by Mumbai Customs, which coupled with anti-China sentiment among trade bodies in recent times in India had made things difficult for the likes of Shein or Club Factory.  Earlier, Local Circles, Confederation of All India Traders (CAIT) and RSS' economic wing Swadeshi Jagran Manch have called for a boycott of Chinese goods. They have alleged that the Chinese ecommerce companies such as Club Factory and Shein receive more than 200K orders per day in India.  They have also alleged that these companies are delivering goods via couriers and postal gift shipments in order to bypass and evade a range of Indian laws on payment gateways, custom duties and GST.","tags":"chinese ecommerce|TAG|shein","category":"Technology","primary_image_url":"https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/cdn.inc42.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/07\/shein-social.jpg?fit=1200%2C628&ssl=1","primary_image_width":1200,"primary_image_height":628,"secondary_image_url":null,"secondary_image_width":0,"secondary_image_height":0,"publisher":"inc42","publisher_domain":"inc42.com"}

As part of the alliance, SUN Mobility will offer its energy infrastructure platform, which includes swappable smart batteries and quick interchange stations to select original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) for building electric autos. The availability of swappable lithium-ion batteries will reduce the overall cost of ownership of such eco-friendly vehicles as batteries constitute almost 40% of the overall cost of an electric vehicle.  The plan is that the fleet owners and Uber's driver partners will benefit because they can buy vehicles without the battery to save money on initial acquisition costs. They will receive charged, swappable batteries as a service by SUN Mobility, thereby helping bring the overall cost of E-Autos in line with their internal combustion engine (ICE) counterpart.

In a bid to ensure greener mobility, the Narendra Modi-led government had taken several steps to promote production and adoption of electric vehicles in India. NITI Aayog had recently proposed that only electric vehicles should be sold in India by 2030. For this, it called for full electric transition for three-wheelers by 2023 and two-wheelers with an engine capacity less than 150 CC by 2025.  In a statement to the Lok Sabha, Minister Of Road Transport And Highways, Nitin Gadkari said that India has 3.97 Lakh registered electric\/battery operated vehicles as of July 9. The details showed that Uttar Pradesh has the highest registered e-vehicles i.e. 1.39 Lakh. It was followed by Delhi and Karnataka at 75.7K and 31.94K respectively.  Sun Mobility and Uber said that they will aim to address the gap between policy and implementation for catering to the country's growing need for cleaner and more sustainable public transport solutions.","tags":"uber|TAG|electric vehicles|TAG|sun mobility","category":"Technology","primary_image_url":"https:\/\/i2.wp.com\/cdn.inc42.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/07\/electric-autos-social.jpg?fit=1200%2C628&ssl=1","primary_image_width":1200,"primary_image_height":628,"secondary_image_url":null,"secondary_image_width":0,"secondary_image_height":0,"publisher":"inc42","publisher_domain":"inc42.com"}

The Samsung Galaxy Note 10 will be the lower-end device of the two with the Galaxy Note 10+ coming with all the bells and whistles of a flagship.  The Samsung Galaxy Note 10 is coming and for those of you who don't think this device will be a stunner, a YouTuber has put together a video showing off the handset from every conceivable angle. This video has been based on leaks and renders so the authenticity may be up for question. However, with the Galaxy Note 10 already leaking in its entirety, we can surely expect this to be the final design of the handset.  Last year's Samsung Galaxy Note9 was one of the stand-out smartphones of the year. It was an all-inclusive, uncompromising device that not just boasted the latest specifications but also had enough going for it to be future-proof for a few generations. The Galaxy Note 10 picks up exactly where its predecessor left off and though it does have some compromises when it comes to the exclusion of some hardware, it more than makes up in terms of raw performance and functionality.  The Samsung Galaxy Note 10 will be the lower-end device of the two with the Galaxy Note 10+ coming with all the bells and whistles of a flagship. The Galaxy Note 10 is expected to ditch the headphone jack and microSD card slot in favour of a marginally larger battery. The capacity of the battery on the Note 10 is believed to be 3600mAh and it will come with some insane fast-charging technology that will be unrivaled.  To the rear, Samsung has redesigned the location of the optics and now it's vertically stacked on the left corner as opposed to the centralized location on the Galaxy Note9. The face of the handset has been altered as well and Samsung is doing something similar to what it did with the Galaxy S9 series. However, the biggest takeaway here is that the punch-hole cut-out will be centrally located as opposed to being fitted on the side. Like the Galaxy S9 before it, the handset will feature an ultrasonic in-display fingerprint scanner that will offer secure biometric authentication. Other notable features include a higher memory configuration that's paired with a Qualcomm Snapdragon 855 or 855 Plus chipset.

Rating:  Amidst a hoard of phones blurring the lines between mid-range and high-end smartphones, Coolpad is one of the few brands left which is still paying attention to blurring the lines between cheap and affordable quality devices. Exhibit A: The Coolpad Cool 3 Plus; a phone that costs half the amount of other 'budget' devices in 2019, and does what it can pretty well.  Build, Design  The moment you take the Coolpad Cool 3 Plus out of its box, the device screams the three magic words everyone wants to hear 'Value for money'.  The device features a glossy, yet gorgeous back with a two-tone gradient design. The one we have is the Ocean Blue variant, which flaunts its cool blue hues on the top as it gradually merges into the Violet below. The device has a compact form factor and seems very sturdy and solidly built. There are no creaky parts that bend in, and\/or make sounds when pressed. The buttons aren't wobbly, and the device feels so good to hold, we considered giving up on other powerful but large phones for a while.  Display  The Cool 3 Plus has a small 5.7-inch HD+ screen with a dew-drop notch. Though it may seem small in 2019, the 1520x720 screen is compact and is one of the few phones where your thumb can reach all corners of the phone, making it truly usable with one hand.  The device features a nice display, the colours look good and the maximum brightness you can get out of the device is decent for the price. The colours sometimes look washed out in games, with excess white tints. However it looked fine on the videos and movies we watched so it isn't an issue with the phone itself. The viewing angles on the Coolpad Cool 3 Plus are amazing and the device loses only a negligible amount of brightness when tilted on its sides.  Software  The device runs on Android 9.0 Pie with Coolpad's own Cool UI on top. While not the lightest of custom UIs, the interface isn't heavy either. It is closer to what stock Android looks like compared to other heavy skins found on devices. The device features minimal bloatware, which basically a couple of bundled apps, that you can uninstall.  The UI itself provides useful features here and there. Apart from the standard App Lock and Face Unlock, the device even supports OTG and has a neat Freezing option where you can suspend apps in a state of limbo. Once frozen, apps only exist on your storage and won't run or consume power and data in the background until you open them again.  Battery  The phone beats our expectations in other departments that average battery life for the price begins to look like a con. The 3000 mAh battery on the Cool 3 Plus takes 2-3 to charge from 0-100 per cent. This partly may be due to the fact that the bundled charger delivers power at only 1 Amp. While we can not expect fast charging on a budget device this cheap, a standard 2 Amp charger would have been great.  However, once you charge the device, the battery life is pretty good and the phone will easily last you for over a day on moderate use. The standby time when the phone is idle is great, but we noticed an accelerated battery draining when we left an OTG pen drive connected to the device overnight; try not to do that.  Performance  The phone runs on a 2.0GHz Mediatek Helio A22 quad-core processor. There are two variants featuring 2GB\/16GB and a 3GB\/32GB RAM and storage. While we have the lower-end version, we'd suggest you go for the higher storage variant unless you're on an absolute strict budget. Since the bare 16GB of internal storage is too low for a phone in this age, it will likely fill up with an average number of installed apps, leaving you minimal space for your photos, videos and other media.  The phone is snappy, and there is pretty much no lag throughout the interface. Though the device is good enough for moderately heavy apps and light to medium games, this is not a device for heavy gaming. Modern graphic intensive titles like PUBG will run on the device but the performance is poor even on low settings. There is a lot of stuttering and frame drops, and the overall experience is frustrating. However, to expect a budget device this cheap to run such titles is asking for too much in the first place.  Camera  The camera setup on the Coolpad Cool 3 Plus is pretty good for the price, albeit very basic. There is a single 8MP camera on the front and a 13MP camera on the back that can record up to 1080p videos. There is an AI mode toggle that assists you with the right settings to take a good picture, a Bokeh mode to take those blurred-out-background shots and a beauty mode to enhance the appearance of your face. There are other features like the ability to take time-lapse videos, add watermarks to the pictures, make GIFs and scan QR codes.  The phone can take decent shots but takes a while to get the focusing right, which is not assisted by any form of stabilisation or fancy features like Laser of Phase detection auto-focusing. So taking good pictures is possible when you have a stable hand, or a surface or stand to rest the device on.  When it comes to still photography, the Cool 3 Plus has a tendency to oversaturate images. While for social media it may be great to have that extra pop in colours; to get a natural image with this handset you may have to do some post processing to have its hues toned down.  Picture without Bokeh Picture with Bokeh  The camera app is easy to use and options and settings are easy to find and navigate. The Bokeh mode works surprisingly well and photos look astonishingly good. When in the Bokeh mode, you even get the option to adjust the aperture of the camera to get a deeper or shallower depth of field effect.  Verdict  The Coolpad Cool 3 Plus is not one of the devices that goes out competing with flagships or mid-rangers. It is clearly a budget phone that excels at every basic task a smartphone can and should be able to do. For the price of Rs 6,000 for the 2GB+16Gb storage variant, and Rs 6,500 for the 3GB+32Gb variant, the phone gets everything right for those on cutthroat budgets.  However, we'd still suggest that buyers go for the higher 3GB RAM variant which costs a mere Rs 500 more.","tags":"smartphone|TAG|mobiles & tabs|TAG|technology|TAG|coolpad|TAG|coolpad cool 3 plus|TAG|review","category":"Technology","primary_image_url":"https:\/\/s3.ap-southeast-1.amazonaws.com\/images.asianage.com\/images\/aa-Cover-tb6kspf4gfd5bg8l1ai8kaesq7-20190722134737.jpeg","primary_image_width":400,"primary_image_height":224,"secondary_image_url":null,"secondary_image_width":0,"secondary_image_height":0,"publisher":"Unavailable","publisher_domain":"Unavailable"}

Ok, let's get this out of the way. The Samsung Galaxy Note 10 hasn't been made official and every bit of information in this post is centred around pure speculation. Till Samsung officially unveils the Galaxy Note 10 and its higher-end sibling, the Galaxy Note 10+; then only we can make a fair assessment of some of the features or lack of it has to offer.  The Samsung Galaxy Note 10 is a deeply polarizing phone, at least this judgment is based on leaks and rumours. The design looks brilliant and it will come with enough technology to keep it relevant for the next few years. However, it appears that some shortcuts have been taken in order to achieve this future-proof handset. And now, finally, we get to know the reason behind one shocking omission.  As per a recent leak by the FCC, we get to know that Samsung won't be including the 3.5mm headphone jack in its upcoming Galaxy Note 10. This was rather baffling especially since the flagship Galaxy S10 devices came bearing it. The Galaxy Note series is known as a have-all, do-it-all smartphone so excluding the headphone jack definitely does raise a few eyebrows. Now, we get to know that Samsung has removed the headphone jack to add a larger battery in the device.  As per a report by TechManiacs, by losing the headphone jack, Samsung has managed to raise the battery capacity of Galaxy Note 10's from 3500mAh to 3600mAh which means it's a 2.85 per cent bump. In the grand scheme of things, the 3600mAh battery doesn't seem to be as big of a draw as the 4000mAh battery on the Note9; however, with One UI's optimizations, it will be able to achieve as much as an all-day battery life which is pretty impressive given the amount of high-end hardware here.  For those of you who are opting for the higher-end Samsung Galaxy Note 10+, you will be getting a massive 4300mAh battery and a microSD card slot, a feature that won't be found on the Galaxy Note 10. With that being said, there still won't be a headphone jack here but, you can expect it to come with some extremely fast battery charging technology that will be unrivalled.","tags":"mobiles & tabs|TAG|galaxy note 10+|TAG|technology|TAG|galaxy note 10|TAG|smartphones|TAG|samsung|TAG|leaks","category":"Technology","primary_image_url":"https:\/\/s3.ap-southeast-1.amazonaws.com\/images.asianage.com\/images\/aa-Cover-jpgidqlmjlt8ue8b24bcufedn6-20190703084041.jpeg","primary_image_width":400,"primary_image_height":224,"secondary_image_url":null,"secondary_image_width":0,"secondary_image_height":0,"publisher":"Unavailable","publisher_domain":"Unavailable"}

The PTron Musicbot Mini is a compact speaker that looks like an NHL hockey puck and because of this design itself, I found a lot of favour in it.  Rating:  Music has been scientifically proven to alleviate stress and in this rat-race called life, a good pair of headphones or a portable speaker is something that every individual the world over needs. Several audio brands have their own itinerary of devices and all of them claim to be better than the next. This makes products all the more difficult to stick out from the crowd. This is where design coupled with audio performance comes in. While there are brands that are able to walk this fine line of design and performance, a lot of them falter when it comes to pricing.  PTron, a brand that needs no introduction in the mobile accessories space has launched the Musicbot Mini, a portable, hockey puck like speaker that not only checks the right boxes when it comes to design and performance but also hits the right note where it matters the most \u2014 price.  Having spent a few days with this mini, powerful, all-around entertaining device, here are my unbiased thoughts on it. And, for a change, they're all positive.  Design, Build  The PTron Musicbot Mini is a compact speaker that looks like an NHL hockey puck and because of this design itself, I found a lot of favour in it. Portable speakers nowadays are less than portable even though they have the portable tag associated with it. This tiny wonder comes with a beautiful design that cannot be bested by anything in its price range and even though it does have this diminutive size, it has enough of heft that give you the impression that it is a capable performer; which by the way it is.  The Musicbot Mini is built from a combination of plastic and metal and these are uncommon traits for a portable speaker priced below Rs 700. On top, the speaker features a concentric circular design which is quite drool-worthy and looks pretty great for any environment; be it an important conference call or an outdoor camping trip. Dressed in Black with silver accents, this is one classy looking speaker that I can blindly recommend based on the design itself.  The tactile buttons for the speaker are placed at the side and not at the top as is the case with some Bluetooth speakers and this is a great design choice from the brand as it gives it a very streamlined design. Apart from the buttons, an interesting addition here is a microSD card slot which can be used to play your favourite tunes if you don't feel like pairing your smartphone.  It can be argued that the lack of a 3.5mm audio jack is a missed opportunity here but with smartphones increasingly losing this feature, PTron isn't obligated to add it, especially considering its Rs 699 price tag.  Coupled with the size and the build quality, the Musicbot Mini has an excellent design and scores full points in this department.  Performance  Having paired the Musicbot Mini with iOS, Android and a laptop, I am pleased to say that the performances are consistent. The speaker features Bluetooth v4.2 and gives you a range of about 10-metres which is more or less accurate. The 3-watt 52mm speakers have a frequency response of 20Hz to 20KHz which is pretty much a standard.  Connecting smartphones and laptops to the speaker are pretty straightforward and there is absolutely no learning curve. You just open the Bluetooth settings on your device and pair it. Even though this speaker has a very competitive price tag, the performances match up to Bluetooth speakers that cost up to three times the price. This makes it all the more appealing and highly recommendable.  I tested the Musicbot Mini with popular genres such as Hip-Hop, Pop, EDM and more and although the brand advertises 'High Bass' it was not overbearing; which is a good thing. There is a significant amount of punch here but just enough not to drown out the other frequencies. Mids are detailed and highs are reaching enough for a speaker at this price point. Overall, you will be fairly satisfied with the overall audio quality as long as you aren't expecting audiophile level performances.  The battery life on the PTron Musicbot is rated at 4-hours and this is about right. However, it does take a bit of a while to top up the 550mAh battery. Charging time from 0-100 is between two to three hours which is a bit long.

Today we saw an excellent video render of the iPhone 11 and no matter what people will say, it is going to be a good-looking device even though it will feature the polarizing square camera hump that's dividing opinions the world over. However, no matter how much anyone may praise the iPhone, this year its number is up as come September, along with the new iPhones, Samsung will launch the Galaxy Fold and Huawei is expected to introduce the Mate X \u2014two foldable smartphones that are expected to absolutely disrupt the smartphone segment.  Earlier this week, Samsung announced that its Galaxy Fold would be made available this September and now; Huawei CEO Richard Yu has been spotted at Shenzhen International Airport flaunting the Mate X. While Samsung has officially confirmed that its Galaxy Fold will launch by September, Huawei's CEO wasn't too forward with launch details about the Mate X. However, official information from Huawei states that it will launch the Mate X in September and this information was provided in June when the brand announced its revised release dates.  While Samsung's delay has been widely written about, Huawei has been less than the public about its reason for delaying the Mate X. Huawei only stated that they were taking a \u201ccautious\u201d approach with releasing the Mate X and that they were doing extensive testing to ensure it was ready for consumers.  As of now, it's unclear what changes if any have been made to the Mate X's design as a result of its extensive testing. However, some reports indicate that Huawei has made significant progress from when they unveiled it back at MWC 2019 in February. A hardware executive has informed TechRadar that its hardware was \u201cbasically the same\u201d as what was displayed earlier this year.  A report by The Verge states, \u201cAlthough its foldable hasn't caused the same publicity nightmare as the Galaxy Fold, Huawei's Mate X could still face difficulties. Not only is the Mate X not going to be released in the US like Huawei's other phones, but Huawei's continued presence on the US Entity List means that its use of Android is still in question. Huawei told CNBC that the Mate X will be allowed to use Android because it was announced before the ban, but with the company's license due to expire on August 19th, it's unclear what the situation with its OS will be.\u201d","tags":"mobiles & tabs|TAG|samsung galaxy fold|TAG|huawei mate x|TAG|iphone 11|TAG|technology|TAG|apple|TAG|foldable smartphones","category":"Technology","primary_image_url":"https:\/\/s3.ap-southeast-1.amazonaws.com\/images.asianage.com\/images\/aa-Cover-l8uufh59rr68jaaqhgvht9ld34-20190622133710.jpeg","primary_image_width":400,"primary_image_height":224,"secondary_image_url":null,"secondary_image_width":0,"secondary_image_height":0,"publisher":"Unavailable","publisher_domain":"Unavailable"}

Make them in the USA, no Tariffs!\u201d Trump tweeted.  On July 18, Apple asked the US Trade Representative's office to waive 25 per cent tariffs on 15 parts, including ones for the Mac Pro desktop computer. The public comment period for those requests closes on Aug. 1.  Trump later told reporters he thought Apple would build a plant in Texas, without elaborating on exactly what he was referring to or how he knew.  \u201cI want Apple to build their plants in the United States. I don't want them to build them in China. So when I heard they were going to build it in China, I said, 'No, that's OK, you can build it in China but when you send your product into the United States we're going to tariff you,\u201d he said.  \u201cWe'll work it out,\u201d he said. \u201cI think they're going to announce that they're going to build a plant in Texas. And if they do that, I'm starting to get very happy.\u201d  The Wall Street Journal reported in June that Apple is shifting manufacturing of its new Mac Pro desktop computer to China from Texas.  Apple issued a statement at the time that \u201clike all of our products, the new Mac Pro is designed and engineered in California and includes components from several countries including the United States\u201d and emphasized that \u201cfinal assembly is only one part of the manufacturing process.\u201d  Representatives for Apple had no immediate comment on either the tariff or Texas plant comments on Friday. Shares of the company sharply pared their gains after the tweets.  Apple CEO Tim Cook in December 2013 announced the company was building the Mac Pro in Texas after coming under criticism for assembling most of its products in lower-wage countries.  Apple does not disclose sales figures for its Mac Pro, but analysts do not believe it is a high-volume seller for the company compared to the iPhone. Priced at USD 6,000 and up, it is aimed at professional users such as movie and music studios.  Trump has previously made claims about Apple's plans to build new US plants, which have not materialized.","tags":"technology|TAG|in other news|TAG|us china trade war|TAG|mac pro|TAG|apple","category":"Technology","primary_image_url":"https:\/\/s3.ap-southeast-1.amazonaws.com\/images.asianage.com\/images\/aa-Cover-an17lvrcpdqb5p53tj9j3rpdq2-20181018094241.jpeg","primary_image_width":400,"primary_image_height":224,"secondary_image_url":null,"secondary_image_width":0,"secondary_image_height":0,"publisher":"Unavailable","publisher_domain":"Unavailable"}

In the chat section, it comes equipped with all these new and cool features which have been combined with Artificial Intelligence to give users a dynamic experience.  Rating:  To put emotions into word has always been a hard thing to do for any human, and then the advent of technology gave us the freedom to connect and communicate literally from anywhere around the world, well, even also from outer space. Now, to communicate is a necessity for us who walk on two feet and are considered to be the smartest animals on our planet. The era of cave paintings and stone carvings, pigeon posts, marathon men, the newspaper, telegraph, telephone, radio signals, etc, all of them passed us, we've entered into a digital age where communication is mainly dominated by mobile phones and its messengers. One such messenger that's popularly used in India is the Hike messaging app, India's first homegrown messaging app which has successfully found a place for itself in a market mostly dominated by foreign options. Since its introduction in the year 2012, Kavin Bharti Mittal's foundation has only been on the up and up, flourishing among the Indian user base.  With everything happening, Hike recently introduced the new expressive Sticker Chat in a bid to reduce people's dependency on the keyboard, making the messaging process more fun, more engaging and interesting. With the Hike Sticker Chat, now one can easily convey their thoughts or feelings without stressing to put everything into words and sentences but through delightful stickers and it's very easy and only a click away.  Overview  One thing that every app developer wants is users spending their time on the app, user engagement with the app is necessary to decide if the app can make or break it in the market and having a clean user interface certainly helps with that.  Hike has a very clean and easy to use interface, there is no difficulty finding or using anything, very simple not at all complicated. Very easy to browse, users can find the moments, chat and stickers tab right in front and below the screen, a simple touch on the preferred tab would take you where you want to go.  In the chat section, it comes equipped with all these new and cool features which have been combined with Artificial Intelligence to give users a dynamic experience. Now you can send a sticker even without typing the entire word, based on the AI's understanding of many situations \u2014 the time of the day, personal tastes, the relationship of a chat (and so much more), the app suggests you find the right sticker at the right time.  Another feature is 'quick follow', with this, you can easily converse without even typing a single word. All that you have to do is, just simply tap on the previous sticker you've sent and it will show suggestions accordingly. Not only limited to your stickers but with the 'quick reply' feature, just tap on the sender's sticker and you'll find personalized sticker recommendations to reply with.  The best feature according to me was the 'text to stickers' attribute. Just type anything as simple as a 'Hi' or a very complicated name of your friend, you'll get a beautifully crafted text to sticker based on a combination of a few fonts and colours that the app automatically puts together.  Verdict  As we've seen and learned about various modes of communicating through a sequence of eras to the present digital day, the idea of expression through words is a complex thing to find. The Hike Sticker Chat simply brings back the expressiveness in interaction through messenger apps without getting complicated and we love it. Simple and easy to understand UI, personalized experience through and out and so many stickers to express all kinds of emotions. Hike offers its stickers services in 29 different regional languages and then there's English too, it's fun, engaging and 100 per cent pragmatic.","tags":"hike stickers chat|TAG|messaging app|TAG|technology|TAG|in other news|TAG|communication|TAG|android","category":"Technology","primary_image_url":"https:\/\/s3.ap-southeast-1.amazonaws.com\/images.asianage.com\/images\/aa-Cover-eh119oo9vp1hekp0tosb24lus6-20190702000037.jpeg","primary_image_width":400,"primary_image_height":224,"secondary_image_url":null,"secondary_image_width":0,"secondary_image_height":0,"publisher":"Unavailable","publisher_domain":"Unavailable"}

Apple expects the iPhone 11 to sell well and its suppliers are reporting that they are in the midst of producing 75 million units of the iPhone 11 line-up; which is approximately the same as orders for the 2018 iPhone XS. As per a report by Apple Insider, these 75 million units is about the same as the iPhone XS, iPhone XS Max and iPhone XR and Apple has strong hopes that demand will remain steady in at least the first few months, despite an overall dip in demand and the trade disputes going on between US and China.  Foxconn has reportedly ramped up its workforce in Shenzhen and they are giving their workers a 10 per cent pay hike to ensure they have enough personnel manufacturing the iPhones. This is despite statements from Foxconn founder who has urged Apple to shift its production away from China over the rising labour costs and US\/China trade tensions.  As per the report, \u201cThe 75 million would only be for the launch period of the device, spanning September, October, and some of November. Apple provides estimated order quantities upfront to device manufacturers, and adjusts them as device demand peaks and wanes, as well as tailoring them for consumer demand of a particular model.\u201d  This is due to the fact that sales have declined and also because of consistent rumours suggesting that the 2020 iPhones will feature major updates including 5G, and an iPad-like Pro Motion display.","tags":"mobiles & tabs|TAG|technology|TAG|iphone 11|TAG|smartphones|TAG|apple","category":"Technology","primary_image_url":"https:\/\/s3.ap-southeast-1.amazonaws.com\/images.asianage.com\/images\/aa-Cover-jpgidqlmjlt8ue8b24bcufedn6-20190726142234.jpeg","primary_image_width":400,"primary_image_height":224,"secondary_image_url":null,"secondary_image_width":0,"secondary_image_height":0,"publisher":"Unavailable","publisher_domain":"Unavailable"}

Rating:  At a time when Cloud storage is gaining a significant amount of traction, the trust we have for physical storage drives is immeasurable. This is mainly due to the numerous horror stories we hear about various cloud storage accounts being hacked and important personal information being shared across the internet without our consent. This isn't to say that physical storage drives are a 100 per cent foolproof solution; but let's be honest, it's the next best thing.  Seagate, one of the most trusted names in the HDD space have recently introduced the Backup Plus Portable external hard drive from its Portable series. Available in both 4TB and 5TB versions, this drive is intended for those who want an all-in-one solution for backing up large banks of media without the need for multiple drives. It works with both Windows and Mac operating systems and features the USB 3.0 interface that's backwards compatible with USB 2.0 ports as well. Apart from this, the Seagate Backup Plus Portable 5TB is loaded with additional features such as auto backups as well as a 1-year Mylio Create membership and a 2-month free Adobe Creative Cloud plan.  Design, Features  Back in 2016, Seagate first introduced a version of this drive and for those of you who have purchased it; you will find telling the new model apart to be a tedious task. Looks-wise there is no difference here and that's a good thing as the previous generation drive was a stunner as it came with a brushed aluminium finish that oozed substance. This drive is no different and Seagate's mantra of don't fix what's not broken rings true with the 2019 version. Considering the fact that the previous version did extremely well with rave reviews across the board, we expect the 2019 model to do as well if not better.  The 2019 Seagate Backup Plus Portable comes with additional features which make it relevant for first-time consumers as they have thrown in a 2-month Adobe Creative Cloud photography plan as well as a 1-year Mylio Create membership. By adding these two options, Adobe has given potential consumers an added impetus to upgrade to the latest version since the previous model came with just Adobe Creative Cloud.  In terms of size, the drive measures 4.539 x 3.15 x 0.823 inches (Length x Width x Depth) and weighs 0.265kgs. To put into this into context, it measures around the size of a hip-flask and it can be pocketable. The Seagate drive is built with a combination of hard plastic and aluminium and it feels very secure. By using this combination of elements, the drive is sturdy enough to withstand accidental bumps. The drive is available in a range of colours such as Light Blue, Silver and Black. In for review, we received the latter model which has a stately appearance to it.  The top of the drive features the Seagate branding and an LED indicator while the reverse displays information regarding the product such as storage information, regulatory certifications, etc. Like most portable drives available in the market, it features a USB B-Type connector while the other end of the cable slots into a standard USB Type-A female port to offer up to 5GB of transfer speeds.  Performance  The Seagate Backup Plus Portable uses the same design technology as the 2016 version and measuring 0.823-inches high, it features the brand's BarraCuda internal drive that combines five 2.5-inch platters that hold a 1TB capacity each.  We ran a few tests on this drive and in the BlackMagic test on a Mac, the drive recorded a speed of 136.1MB\/s in read speeds and 132.3MB\/s in write. While testing it on a Windows with the ATTO benchmarking tool, we found similar Read speeds but much lower Write speeds. Taking these scores into consideration, the Seagate drive fares as promised and is on par with benchmarks set by rival brands.  Overall, the Seagate drive is a very solid performer that bests what's available in the market. While the hard drive may not feature blitzkrieg speeds, it is by no means slow and performs at half the speed of its SSD cousins; which is saying quite a lot for an external HDD.  While storage space may be the ultimate intention for buying this product and let's face it, 5TB is plenty lot; the other reason which makes this a recommended accessory are the additional features Seagate throws in. With Adobe Creative Cloud, Seagate offers you two-months membership worth USD 19.98 where you can easily edit, store, organise and share full-resolution photos from anywhere. Whether it's editing photos with Lightroom CC or creating artwork with Photoshop CC, this two-month plan has got you covered.  Your 1-year Mylio Create account begins as soon as you register your drive and with it, you can organize your photos, automate protection and see them on all your devices. With this photo-storage service, you can store images that can be viewed on plenty of devices as well as computers. The software advertises itself as, \u201cOne app to collect all your photos, videos and documents into a single library, automatically organizing them into a visual story of your life.\u201d So apart from storage, you can also edit images, including RAW files with filters, presets and more. Essentially, it is a service that allows you to sync and view all your images and videos from various devices in a single place.  Apart from these handy tools, there's also an interesting service which Seagate offers and that's Rescue Data Recovery. With this service, Seagate is offering their professionals to try and recover your lost data which may have been accidentally deleted. And what's better, this service is valid for up to two years from the time you purchase the drive.  Verdict  The Seagate Backup Plus Portable starts at Rs 11,999 for the 4TB version while the 5TB model I priced at Rs 16,499. This drive is marketed at those who require a lot of storage in the most compact form factor as possible. This drive is ideal for video editors, game developers, VFX artists or anyone who requires a lot of space on the go. This drive is priced very competitively in India and along with the additional services on offer, we put this drive as a must purchase item. With the Backup Plus Portable, Seagate is offering you what very few other brands can and throw in the auto-sync features along with customizable back-up, you get a winner any which way you look at it.","tags":"external hdd|TAG|technology|TAG|gadgets|TAG|review|TAG|seagate backup plus portable","category":"Technology","primary_image_url":"https:\/\/s3.ap-southeast-1.amazonaws.com\/images.asianage.com\/images\/aa-Cover-l8uufh59rr68jaaqhgvht9ld34-20190625151050.jpeg","primary_image_width":400,"primary_image_height":224,"secondary_image_url":null,"secondary_image_width":0,"secondary_image_height":0,"publisher":"Unavailable","publisher_domain":"Unavailable"}

The Galaxy Tab S6 should be unveiled on August 7, 2019, and will not just rival but kill the Apple iPad Pro.","tags":"mobiles & tabs|TAG|technology|TAG|tablet|TAG|android|TAG|samsung galaxy tab s6","category":"Technology","primary_image_url":"https:\/\/s3.ap-southeast-1.amazonaws.com\/images.asianage.com\/images\/aa-Cover-jpgidqlmjlt8ue8b24bcufedn6-20190708141740.jpeg","primary_image_width":400,"primary_image_height":224,"secondary_image_url":null,"secondary_image_width":0,"secondary_image_height":0,"publisher":"Unavailable","publisher_domain":"Unavailable"}

Rating:  RHA as a brand can't be compared with as they are in a league of their own. There has been no audio brand that has created such a decorated story in its short existence that you have to actually stop and take notice; then sit back and go wow. Famous for its in-ear earphones, this award-winning British brand has built up a reputation for dropping products that have the right amount of precision as well as accuracy that's somewhat lacking in most mainstream rivals.  RHA has recently introduced the TrueConnect true wireless earphones and unlike the hordes of models available out there, these sit in the premium category and have the dubious distinction of being priced on par with Apple's latest generation AirPods. While comparisons are all but natural, these earphones stand out from the crowd as it comes with an innovative design and exceptional sound; putting them in a category of its own.  Having spent a fair share of time with the RHA TrueConnect, here are my unbiased thoughts on them.  Design, Build  The RHA TrueConnect is one of the brand's newest true wireless earphones and unlike most competitors that come with a generic earbud-style design or something that resembles the Apple AirPods, and let's be real \u2014 everyone is copying everyone. With these RHA earphones, you get something that's familiar but not quite and that's the best part about them. These earphones come with the stem-style design that's found on the Apple AirPods as well as the newly launched Skullcandy Indy true wireless earphones. However, there's a welcome change on the RHA TrueConnect. These earphones have a stem that sticks out at the bottom as well but doesn't protrude out all the way. These short stems help with the overall comfort level which I feel are better than Apple's option \u2014 a pair I use quite a lot.  While comfort is taken care of by the brand's beautiful and ergonomic design; the fact that the ear tips can be replaced adds to the overall experience of the RHA TrueConnect. These earphones are so comfortable that when in use they feel pretty non-existent. While they are certainly comfortable, an issue I faced was that they feel like they would fall out of the ear. This can be quite bothersome as if you happen to use them while walking outdoors; your Rs 15K investment could be lying on the street \u2014lost.  The RHA TrueConnect comes with an all matte-black design and if there were any anti-Apple earphones out there, this would be a sure shot contender for the role. RHA has done well with the overall design of these earbuds as they feature a soft rubber coating that makes them appear downright gorgeous. The charging case is made of this same finish as the buds giving it an extremely classy look and feel.  These earphones have just a single button on each bud and these control various aspects such as play\/pause, changing tracks and yes, even adjusting the volume. This feature in itself puts it ahead of Apple AirPods as the ability to adjust the volume on the earphones themselves saves a lot of time and by and large is just so convenient. It may take a day or two to get used to the controls but trust me; it makes your life simpler in the long run.  Moving on, the charging case is easily one of the best out there. If we had to put a ranking to it, it would sit alongside the AirPods charging case. Built of a combination of materials, is super classy any way you look at it. The aluminium adds to the premium feel the brand is looking for and they have nailed it right on the head with every design aspect of the RHA TrueConnect. Also, the brand has ensured that it is future proof by adding a USB Type-C charging port here allowing your earbuds to get juiced up faster than those earbuds that ship with the old micro USB port. To gauge the battery level in the case, RHA has fitted three white LED indicators on the top. Overall, this is a classy affair and checks all the right boxes where design and build is concerned.  Performance  The RHA TrueConnect is fitted with the latest technology there is which ensures that it has a long life and also justify its premium price tag. These buds feature 6mm dynamic drivers with a frequency response of 20 to 20,000Hz and connectivity is made possible by adding Bluetooth v5.0.  While this may be a minor point to most, the connectivity on these babies is one of the best I have experience on a pair of true wireless earphones. In fact, they can even be compared to the rock-solid connection that's witnessed on the Apple AirPods. When it comes to true wireless earphones, maintaining a strong connection is very vital. These types of earphones are still in its early stages and maintaining a steady connection is proving a bit problematic for most brands. RHA has made sure they send out products that are not just a finished article, but a product that can perform well enough to beat the competition. The talk between both earbuds is extremely great too and even while streaming videos as there are no lip sync issues noticed, something we have seen on quite a few true wireless earphones even priced a lot higher.  While all the features check out great, the audio quality is what matters the most and I am pleased to say that the RHA TrueConnect delivers where similarly priced rivals fail \u2014 and that's truly saying a lot!  Optimal audio performance has been a pain point for true wireless a headphone as there always is a disturbance that prevails. This model doesn't face any issues and overall, the audio performance has a tonal balance that rivals wired earphones. Elaborating on the overall audio quality, these earbuds have a bass output that packs a restrained punch. So, while the bass has sufficient impact, it does drown out the other frequencies making it extremely tight. Highs are pretty great here as well and have a reach which other true wireless buds can't match up to. Mids on the TrueConnect are as impressive as they are straightforward which leaves us very satisfied. For most genres, these earbuds do great and you will be left more than satisfied.  The battery life on the TrueConnect is great as well. RHA promises a 5-hour battery life on a single top-up and the charging case holds another 20 hours of juice. In all, you get a massive 25 hours of playback before you need to recharge them. Coming with a USB Type-C port, RHA has also added fast charging capabilities where an hour and a half of charge will fully charge the case.  Verdict  Priced at Rs 14,999, the RHA TrueConnect fit in the premium true wireless category. With these babies, you get an unrivalled audio performance that can match not just some of the best earphones available but also some of the top-end headphones out there. With a design that oozes class and audio performance that never ceases to amaze me; the RHA TrueConnect live up to its price tag and make them a choice for one of the best true wireless products of the year.","tags":"technology|TAG|true wireless|TAG|earphones|TAG|gadgets|TAG|rha trueconnect|TAG|review","category":"Technology","primary_image_url":"https:\/\/s3.ap-southeast-1.amazonaws.com\/images.asianage.com\/images\/aa-Cover-l8uufh59rr68jaaqhgvht9ld34-20190628154801.jpeg","primary_image_width":400,"primary_image_height":224,"secondary_image_url":null,"secondary_image_width":0,"secondary_image_height":0,"publisher":"Unavailable","publisher_domain":"Unavailable"}

The phone is even the first device to use the new snapdragon 855+ processor by Qualcomm.  Not long ago, Asus unveiled the ROG Phone II, which was a successor to the popular ROG Phone, which was again, one of the first dedicated gaming devices to ditch the innovative features of the era which are no more than just gimmicks for most hardcore gamers.  The philosophy behind the ROG phones focus more on the elements that matter, and ones that make a phone a proper 'gaming device'.  Now Asus has worked on the same philosophy for the ROG Phone II. The phone is even the first device to use the new snapdragon 855+ processor by Qualcomm. The phone has apparently become very successful ahead of the first flash sale on July 31.  Also read: ASUS ROG Phone II Complete specifications and accessories list  Over 1.6 million people have already registered for the first sale. The main reason for this maybe that the phone is priced at only USD 510, which is not a lot considering the specs the phone brings with it.  However, the reduced price is due to Asus being helped by Tencent, the makers behind popular Battle-Royale title PUBG. Since Tencent helped build the ROG Phone II, the phone is likely to come with some bloat by the company.  You could alternatively get the non-Tencent version of the device too, but that would set you back by USD 900, which is much more than the previous option. The phone will likely launch in China by as early as next week, the phone will be internationally available around mid-August.","tags":"mobiles & tabs|TAG|technology|TAG|tencent|TAG|asus|TAG|asus rog phone ii","category":"Technology","primary_image_url":"https:\/\/s3.ap-southeast-1.amazonaws.com\/images.asianage.com\/images\/aa-Cover-jpgidqlmjlt8ue8b24bcufedn6-20190723085550.jpeg","primary_image_width":400,"primary_image_height":224,"secondary_image_url":null,"secondary_image_width":0,"secondary_image_height":0,"publisher":"Unavailable","publisher_domain":"Unavailable"}

Rating:  Shenzhen-based Chinese smartphone manufacturer Realme came to India just over a year ago and has thrived among the general population since then. Making its debut in the country with the Realme 1 on May 2018, the company sold more than 400,000 units in the first 30 days on Amazon India exclusively. The Realme 1 sold itself as a budget device, offering 6GB of RAM and 128 GB of internal storage for Rs 12,990 as the higher variant of the model. Like a snowballing effect, the company kept on delivering handsets which were a huge crowd pleasers.  With same consistency, the company has yet again brought in a device which fits perfectly in budget and delivers big in overall performance, the Realme 3i! It sports a 6.2-inch HD+ (1520x720) display with a 19:9 aspect ratio and Corning Gorilla Glass 3 protection. Under the hood is a 2.0 GHz MediaTek Helio P60 octa-core chipset combined with 4GB RAM and 64 GB of internal storage. Equipped with a huge 4230 mAh battery, the phone ensures you won't run out of juice in the time of need. The eyes at the rear of the handset are a 13MP f\/1.8 primary camera and a 2MP secondary depth camera and upfront, the Realme 3i gets a 13MP selfie camera. Running on Android Pie-based Color OS 6 the phone's interface is equally capable of giving an experience as the specs suggest.  Going through the specs, one may find it quite similar to the previous Realme C2 or even the Realme 3; in fact, the 3i is a version of the Realme 3. However, our experience with the Realme 3i was a totally different one and in this review, we'll be analysing the device to its fullest extent.  Design and body  With a diamond-cut pattern on the rear panel, it not only looks good but also feels really good and premium in hand. With zero doubts, the device is a BEAUTY! To make it look different from the previous Realme 3 device, the makers here decided to go with a diamond-cut pattern on a plastic panel that offers a matte-finish. Although, the diamond-cut pattern has been used by the company before, for example, the Realme C2. The unique aspect in the 3i would be the colour combinations it's been offered in - Diamond Black, Diamond Blue and Diamond Red.  The one we had was in a Diamond Blue shade which felt really premium to look at. The textured matte finish gave the device a pleasant shade which wasn't too shiny or glossy to look at. This finish makes the device a bit slippery but inside the box comes a transparent back cover which ensures that you don't have to compromise on all its good looks. Good looks apart, the rear of the device is made of plastic and is quite tough to easily take a hard knock or two and still survive all of it.  On the right-hand side of the device sits the lock\/power button and on the left-hand side lies the volume up\/down key, the sim card and the MicroSD tray. On the front on top is the ear speaker right above the front camera in the centre, beneath is the loudspeaker and microphone grille with the 3.5mm audio jack and a standard micro USB port.  On the rear is a fingerprint scanner, fast and accurate working like a charm. On above and left, the eyes of the device are placed and just down below that, name of the company is imprinted. \u201cVery neat, sturdy and detailed,\u201d is how we would like to term the design and build of the device.  Display  Being a budget smartphone priced right in the 10k segment, the Realme 3i is equipped with a 6.2-inch LCD HD+ (1520x720) display with a 19:9 aspect ratio and Gorilla Glass 3 protection. With the dewdrop notch on the front and minimal bezels, the smartphone sports a huge display with 88.3 per cent screen to body ratio. Viewing angles are great, giving you a crisp display easily even on a 180-degree angle (a flat angle).  The graphic renderer ARM Mali-G72 MP3 gives an overall 270 PPI pixel density, highlighting colours on the screen to appear more defined \u2014 ultimately boosting the total viewing experience on the device, whether be playing a game or watching a movie, the colour balance is simply perfect. The brightness levels have the auto-brightness option which basically adjusts the brightness on the screen according to surrounding lights which also helps save a lot of battery on the device.  Software  Like many other Realme phones, the 3i also runs on the Android Pie based Color OS 6. Giving an easy to understand UI and a neat layout on the phone, everything is stacked accordingly in its place. The phone initially comes with pre-installed company apps and few others used in common, however, one can choose to uninstall these if needed.  From the main screen, one has to swipe up from below the screen to access the app drawer or you can easily stack your favourite apps on one of the main screens. As the name of the OS suggests, it is stocked with a variety of colourful wallpapers by default. The Color OS 6 is all about customisations and one can personalise the whole UI as per their convenience.  Overall performance  Powering the device is an Helio P60 chipset combined with 4GB of RAM and 64GB of internal storage. The chipset is a bit outdated for 2019 but again as a budget phone it is nothing but a sensible decision for keeping the prices in check. The P60 is a 12nm-based octa-core processor capable of running day-to-day operations with ease and even can assist the gamer in you. Although, while playing high-end games such as PUBG we recommend you to play it on the lowest settings possible to experience a seamless battle royale event.  Cameras  This budget Realme 3i has the eyes to capture every detail in a stunning fashion. The rear has a dual-camera setup that includes a 13MP f\/1.8 primary camera and a 2MP secondary depth sensor, and in front, a 13MP camera inside the dewdrop notch placed in the centre to capture all the selfie action. The cameras on this device certainly do their job with utmost perfection. In our experience, we found the Chroma Boost mode come in very handy. Basically, this mode pumps up the saturation levels but in a very balanced way, unlike many other phones which are priced way above this, we totally recommend the Chroma Boost mode while clicking landscapes from its eyes. Even when clicked moving at a good speed or at the maximum zoom level i.e. 4X on the device, the processed images had the needed sharpness preserved.  Battery  Packing up on a huge 4230 mAh battery, the phone stays alive with you easily throughout the whole day. A full day of continuous usage and after some gaming action, the phone still had enough juice left to take on at least half the day tomorrow. A decent battery performance here as it took nearly about 2 hours to recharge from 0 to 100 and it's not fast charging supported or a Type-C.  Verdict  The Realme 3i comes in two variants \u2013 3GB\/32GB priced at Rs 7,999 and the 4GB\/64GB priced at Rs 9,999 in India. Realme have delivered consistently in the budget smartphone segment and certainly are among the favourites. The Realme 3i is a perfect device for anyone who's looking for something inside the 10k budget, not only performance-wise but with a unique design and sturdy built quality, the phone is an absolute standout and surely makes an ideal companion.","tags":"mobiles & tabs|TAG|technology|TAG|realme 3i|TAG|realme 3i review","category":"Technology","primary_image_url":"https:\/\/s3.ap-southeast-1.amazonaws.com\/images.asianage.com\/images\/aa-Cover-pchrhofirmi4uto5gh0ttbqp05-20190716162920.jpeg","primary_image_width":400,"primary_image_height":224,"secondary_image_url":null,"secondary_image_width":0,"secondary_image_height":0,"publisher":"Unavailable","publisher_domain":"Unavailable"}

Rating:  When driving in your car, the experience should be fun. Pedestrians and other vehicles that cross your path are what you are mostly bothered about and especially when you happen to be in an accident with no fault of yours. As a driver, you would definitely be the first to take a beating by the public (and the law), even with probably no fault of your own. And here comes in-car video recorders or dash cameras that can help save your day.  One such dash camera by Yi Technologies, a Chinese tech brand, was introduced in the Indian market last month. The YI Smart Dash Camera seems to be one of the best single-lens dash cameras we have seen in India and can term it as a must-have accessory for every car owner.  Priced within a decent budget of Rs 5,899, the YI Smart Dash Camera is a very simple, rugged and highly compact dash camera. It can be installed and mounted to your windscreen within 10 - 15 minutes and you are good to go. Barely larger than a regular matchbox, the camera sports a 2.7-inch LCD display panel along with a control panel on the bottom. The front features a single camera with a 165-degree wide-angle lens (f\/1.8). A mounting fixture resides on the top, while a micro USB and microSD card slot take up the left and right sides.  Installation is a cakewalk. Simply mount the camera on your windscreen, run the bundled cable around the dashboard to the bundled USB power charger and drive. You may need to fine-tune the settings to get the maximum results from the camera, and this includes video resolution settings between 720p, 1080p and 1296p @30fps or @60fps accordingly. Audio recording, G-sensor, display time outs and ADAS (Advanced Driver Assistant System) are other options to choose from.  You will need a 32GB (recommended) microSD card to store an average of 5 hours of footage and this depends on the resolution you choose. Videos are recorded in H.264 (.MP4) formats to save on space. We recommend the highest resolution (1296p@30fpd) for best results in video quality. The camera also features loop recording but does not support manual video time limits or lengths. It automatically stores videos of around 3 minutes each. The dash camera also supports Wi-Fi with a paired smartphone app to view live feeds, save recordings and tweak settings remotely. The YI Smart Dash Camera also has a tiny battery within to save videos when shutting and also allows you to view\/record some footage for around 5 minutes more.  The Yi dash camera is driven by Yi's own 40nm A12 chip featuring a dual-core processor and a DSP processor. The camera automatically turns on and starts recording (by default) when you turn on your engine. LEDs (orange and red) are present below the display to notify the status on recording and power respectively. You can also control the camera from the smartphone app.  If you want to record a 10-second video (in an emergency) simply hit the record button and a 10-second footage is stored immediately. If your vehicle experiences a crash, an emergency recording is also kicked in automatically.  We drove our car around the city to test the performance of the camera during broad daylight, in the evening and around the nights. Footage during the day is very clear \u2014 crisp details (in 1296p) of the road ahead, people and traffic around were captured. Brightly lit areas such as the sky or white-painted buildings reflecting the bright sunlight were a bit difficult to capture as they were being washed out a little. However, thanks to the e-HDR Generation 2 technology by Yi, you can capture better videos in comparison to conventional dash cameras. Better visibility in low light areas such as tunnels, basement parking, etc also turned out good.  With the 165-degree wide-angle lens, (it does give a slightly fish-eye appearance) the entire front view from all three lanes up ahead are easily viewed. As for the ADAS feature, a smartphone needs to be connected as the camera does not sport onboard GPS and uses the smartphone for the required data.  Footage during the night is very good too with the exposure levels automatically increasing to make the objects in the video appear brighter. Sadly, headlights from oncoming traffic do cause issues. Overall, the night time footage and low light areas are well captured in the video.  The iOS\/Android app also allows you to connect to multiple cameras if you plan to use more than one camera in your car or have multiple cars with this camera. You can setup timestamps and watermarks too. Download the videos you wish to save directly to your smartphone. You can also trim important parts of the video before downloading so you can save on unwanted footage and data. Sadly, downloading the videos using Wi-Fi is pretty slow, but you can always pop out the micro SD card and plug it to your PC\/laptop for faster transfers.  Verdict:  We recommend the Yi Smart Dash Camera for every car owner. No matter how safe a driver you are, a dashcam will be your third eye to keep watch on the road and keep you safe in case you meet up with an unfortunate incident. With ADAS feature, a 165-degree wide-angle lens, Wi-Fi connectivity and easy to use interface, the YI Smart Dash Camera is a smart and must-have accessory for your car.","tags":"technology|TAG|gadgets|TAG|dash camera|TAG|yi smart|TAG|review","category":"Technology","primary_image_url":"https:\/\/s3.ap-southeast-1.amazonaws.com\/images.asianage.com\/images\/aa-Cover-jpgidqlmjlt8ue8b24bcufedn6-20190724121504.jpeg","primary_image_width":400,"primary_image_height":224,"secondary_image_url":null,"secondary_image_width":0,"secondary_image_height":0,"publisher":"Unavailable","publisher_domain":"Unavailable"}

Rating:  For the past few years, noise-cancelling headphones have been the sure-shot option for those who are frequent jet setters and smart commuters as they offer you an unrivalled music listening experience without having to bear the hustle and bustle of daily life that inevitably invade your personal space. These noise-cancelling headphones, though useful, are not many people's cup of tea as firstly, they come with a huge price tag for a quality product and secondly, they are on the tad larger side making them less than portable.  Recently, with technology advancing audio brands have started adding active noise cancelling technology in earphones and these have way more advantages than headphones. The first being that they are highly portable and secondly, they don't cost as much.  Keeping in tune with this philosophy, Claw, a brand that's rapidly creating a niche for itself in the audio space has launched a pair of active noise-cancelling earphones called the ANC7 that are not just well priced but sound pretty great as well. After testing these earphones for a substantial amount of time, here are my unbiased thoughts on them.  Design, Build  The Claw ANC7 comes in no-nonsense Black with Silver accents that allow it to suit a professional environment as well as fit in effortlessly in a casual environment. Coming in this colour, the ANC7 has the timeless appeal that allows you to flaunt it for years on end without ever appearing boring or dull. To complement its classy appearance, Claw has fitted it with the most premium materials such as aluminium which makes the casing of the earbuds quite durable.  These earphones are lightweight as well at just 22.8g which allow you to listen to it for hours on end without experiencing any fatigue. To ensure that the earphones fit every consumer, the brand has thrown in multiple eartips of various sizes as well as ear hooks that allow them to stay locked in securely without falling out. There are dual-in-line remotes, one which houses the noise cancelling and monitoring mode controls and the other which houses the microphone and controls for volume, playback and call functions. The former in-line control is made of aluminium which feels absolutely premium. Claw has also used a MEMS noise-cancelling microphone that's built-in which helps in offering you a clearer conversation by offering an undisturbed voice transmission. When not in use, you can easily store the earphones in a travel pouch that comes as a part of the packaging.  Elaborating on the noise cancellation unit, apart from building it with premium materials, Claw has used a slider button for activating the active noise cancellation. The monitor mode is a quick and seamless way to switch out of noise-cancelling without turning it off. It can be useful during crossing the road or just taking in ambient sounds when necessary. There is a micro USB charging port at the bottom of this unit that offers you up to 16 hours of ANC and it also comes with support for a quick charge where a mere five minute of charge can provide you with up to two hours of ANC.  While the build of the in-ear monitors and the dual-in-line modules are great, the cables feel a bit flimsy and I feel that if they are jerked a bit too hard, then they may actually detach and break. This is a bit worrying considering how much you are paying for your audio investment.  Performance  When it comes to the overall performance of the Claw ANC7, they do exceedingly well in all aspects. Comfort is one of the top priorities here and since they feature flat earbuds, they can be used extensively even while lying down on your side and cause you no pain whatsoever. Although the cables aren't made of the sturdiest of materials, they are tangle-free which gives them an advantage over others in and around this price range.  As far as audio quality goes, the Claw ANC7 is an extremely strong performer and there is an exquisite detailed heard with the ANC turned on. I found there to be ample space and even complex tunes don't appear muddy with there being a wide amount of definition all over. The performance of the mids can be classified as lush and I observed a mid-bass bump that gives the Claw ANC7 a tonal balance that was bordering on warm. The bass has the desired impact and extension and this is what a consumer would absolutely love about these in-ear monitors. Lastly, the earphones create a nice seal that aids with the active noise cancellation feature here.  Coming with a 95mAh battery, Claw promises that with the ANC on, you can block out unwanted environmental sounds by up to 97 per cent which is quite impressive and it provides you with an immersive auditory experience.  Verdict  The Claw ANC7 is priced at Rs 4,490 in India and for the features thrown in; these are really quite worth every single rupee they cost. Now, no longer you have to pay north of Rs 10K for noise-cancelling headphones which are huge and mostly uncomfortable to lug around as Claw is offering you an option of a lightweight experience that will touch your senses in the way only a strong performer can. And what may come as good news to those who are looking to purchase it; these earphones are also selling on various online retail channels for as low as Rs 3,590 making it an even more alluring option.","tags":"technology|TAG|gadgets|TAG|review|TAG|earphone|TAG|claw anc7","category":"Technology","primary_image_url":"https:\/\/s3.ap-southeast-1.amazonaws.com\/images.asianage.com\/images\/aa-Cover-jpgidqlmjlt8ue8b24bcufedn6-20190727125731.jpeg","primary_image_width":400,"primary_image_height":224,"secondary_image_url":null,"secondary_image_width":0,"secondary_image_height":0,"publisher":"Unavailable","publisher_domain":"Unavailable"}

Rating:  1MORE are continuously setting the standard of what quality earphones are supposed to be. This year, the brand is implementing a new approach in a bid to reach a far wider and more discerning audience. With its Stylish series, 1MORE is offering users the opportunity to witness truly great audio and also look great flaunting their products.  The 1MORE Stylish True Wireless is the newest model from the brand's Stylish series and boy are these babies pretty to look at. With the new option, 1MORE doesn't want you to merely enjoy the freedom from wires; they want you to look good doing so.  The 1MORE Stylish True Wireless is priced extremely competitively in a sea that's rapidly getting overcrowded with options spanning different price points. At Rs 8,999, these are the brand's first foray in the true wireless spectrum and looking at the spec sheet, these earbuds are completely power-packed.  Design, Build  The 1MORE Stylish True Wireless earbuds have a lot going for it in terms of style and build. Built entirely out of plastic, these earphones are completely lightweight which makes for comfortable listening even for prolonged periods of time. However, coming with an all-plastic build, they feel a bit cheap to the touch and not premium. It's actually funny because 1MORE was going for an all-around 'Stylish' appearance and this model sadly loses out on that title. If these earbuds did not have the 'Stylish' tag associated with it, we could cut it some slack; however, that's just not the case.  As mentioned earlier, these earbuds are extremely comfortable to use. Shaped like little pebbles, they sit snug in your ear cavity without ever giving you the feeling that they will fall out. I used these earbuds in a variety of environments and doing a ton of activities and they never budged even slightly. If only more earbuds were made like the Stylish True Wireless, they would give them 1MORE a run for its money. Being true wireless earphones, comparisons with market leader, Apple AirPods naturally occur. While Apple's option is a one size fits all and if they don't it's your loss; thankfully that's not the case with these. 1MORE throws in additional ear tips and ear hooks to suit different ear sizes. We found this touch of personalization quite endearing as the brand ensures that these earphones are meant for absolutely everyone. 1MORE calls these wings O-hooks and they help with the additional stability when seated in your ear. Another advantage which these O-hooks provide is that they offer a seal that doesn't allow external noises to seep in; which is effective for the most part as it helps with the overall bass response found here. As mentioned, there's no one size fits all, so it's better to try on all options till you're completely satisfied. I found the ones that came packaged were the best ones for me as it offered a great, snug and comfortable fit.  The egg-shaped charging case is cute and compact and that's not it! You also get a massive 24-hours of total playback here. While the charging case is one of the most portable ones out there; it does have its drawbacks. The first and biggest miss for me was the lack of a Type-C port. If 1MORE did, in fact, add a USB Type-C port over here, chances are that the price would have shot up quite a bit. While the compromise does make sense, I feel keeping it future proof is much more worthwhile. The second issue we had with it was the lack of a battery indicator. There are true wireless earbuds available in the market at a dirt-cheap rate that offer LED battery indicators on the charging case. I don't know why 1MORE skipped this useful and necessary feature. However, there is a charging indicator here and when it goes off; this means that the battery is topped up.  The case is spring-loaded and the only way to check on the battery is to peer at the earbuds sitting in its cradle.  Performance  To start off, let me just get this out of the way \u2014 the audio quality of the 1MORE Stylish True Wireless earbuds are exemplary and based on this sole feature, it gets thrown to the top of our recommended list. With that being said, there are certain other performance issues which are quite a letdown which cannot be ignored.  To start of this section of the review I will first talk about the audio quality. These earbuds come with 7mm dynamic drivers that boast a titanium composite diaphragm that helps in emitting the finer details as well as offering an above-average bass output. The basic audio performance for me depended on how great the seal was and with the ear tips and hooks that came straight out of the box; I got the best experience imaginable. An issue with most true wireless earbuds is that there is an audio hiss that appears because let's face it; these form of earphones are still in its nascent stages and not as refined as traditional Bluetooth earphones. I am delighted to say that with these, there was no such sound emitted. The bass output from the True Wireless had a nice, crisp punch to it while highs had sufficient amount of extension which makes for pleasant listening. The overall soundstage is pretty good for earphones of this type but not audiophile-grade; getting no real complaints from me.  While the audio performance here is nothing short of great as it also supports aptX and AAC, there are a few issues which I can't ignore. The number one being connectivity which is strange since it features Bluetooth 5.0 as well as a Qualcomm chip that offers a fast and stable connection. While using these outdoors, the earbuds would intermittently lose its signal from the source. This anomaly was witnessed on both Android and iOS devices. This is most likely due to wireless interference that's very largely prevalent outdoors. The regular stutter or loss of connection made for an unpleasant listening experience.  The other issue I faced with the Stylish True Wireless earbuds was that every time I removed them from the charging case, they would not immediately connect to my smartphone. To ensure that it paired successfully I had to enter the Bluetooth settings on my device and reconnect the earbuds. This gets a bit annoying especially when you have to do it pretty frequently.  The third issue I faced with them wasn't as frequent as the first two but annoying nonetheless. When removing the earphones from the charging case only one earbud would turn on. To enable the second earbud, I had to press the single multifunction button so that they both worked.  These earbuds come with a high-stability MEMS microphone with DSP technology that helps in cancelling out ambient noises. During my testing, the earphones performed as advertised and the recipient could hear me very clearly without any issues.  Moving on, the battery life of the earbuds is rated at 6.5 hours on a single charge and in my week-long testing, I found this to be pretty accurate with the volume set at about 50 per cent. The charging case gives you a total of 24 hours and what's even more impressive is that it comes with fast charge. A 15-minute charge will give you as much as 3-hours of playback which is sufficient for completing most tasks such as watching a movie, finishing a gym session and other activities.  Verdict  Available in four beautiful colours \u2014 Pink, Gold, Green and Black as well as being priced attractively at Rs 8,999; these make for an excellent option if attractive looking earphones with great audio quality are your thing. These are definitely head-turners and we guarantee you if you purchase any colour apart from black you are definitely going to be noticed; thereby raising your style quotient greatly. However, when it comes to the build quality, the plastic body put me off and what lost these earphones some of its points are the connectivity issues which can't be ignored as you won't get an ideal listening experience. If you have no problems with this and want an otherwise excellent option when it comes to audio quality, then the 1MORE Stylish True Wireless is an ideal choice for you.","tags":"technology|TAG|earphones|TAG|gadgets|TAG|review|TAG|1more stylish true wireless","category":"Technology","primary_image_url":"https:\/\/s3.ap-southeast-1.amazonaws.com\/images.asianage.com\/images\/aa-Cover-jpgidqlmjlt8ue8b24bcufedn6-20190712131605.jpeg","primary_image_width":400,"primary_image_height":224,"secondary_image_url":null,"secondary_image_width":0,"secondary_image_height":0,"publisher":"Unavailable","publisher_domain":"Unavailable"}

One of the biggest pain points with Apple MacBooks from the last few years has been with its butterfly keyboard design. This caused a wide range of issues and many had to turn in their laptops to be fixed. Now, one of the worst issues with the MacBook Pro will finally get a fix this year as Apple will reportedly move away from the butterfly keyboard in favour of a more reliable scissor mechanism design. And, as per a research note by reputed Apple analyst, Ming-Chi Kuo, Apple will introduce this new keyboard on its upcoming 16-inch MacBook that's still a unicorn right now.  Kuo, an analyst at TF International Securities in Asia claims that Apple will incorporate its new scissor mechanism in the keyboards and the 16-inch MacBook Pro will be the first to feature it. This upcoming MacBook Pro is stated to launch in the last quarter of 2019. After which, Apple will launch all of its upcoming laptops with this style keyboard in 2020.  As per a related report by CultofMac, \u201cIf you've been thinking about buying a new MacBook Pro in 2019 but can't afford the rumoured $3,000 price tag of the upcoming 16-inch MacBook Pro, you probably should wait. Apple's flawed butterfly keyboard design sparked a recall petition because the keys frequently stick or become unresponsive. Apple now offers free repairs for all MacBook models that use the butterfly keyboard design, including the MacBook Pros that just came out this month.\u201d  Moving over to the new butterfly keyboards will save Apple some cash as well as they cost more to manufacture in comparison with scissor keyboards. As per reports, Apple plans to pay between USD 25 to USD 30 for its keyboard components which is much more than the average price of USD 8 to USD 12. These new keyboards will supposedly be supplied Sunrex.  The new report deviates from Kuo's earlier letter to investors that claimed that the 2019 MacBook Air would be the first to feature this scissor-style keyboard and based on recent reports, this no longer appears to be the case. This would essentially make the 16-inch MacBook Pro the only laptop from Apple this year to come with this new keyboard.","tags":"16-inch macbook pro|TAG|technology|TAG|keyboard|TAG|macbook pro|TAG|gadgets|TAG|apple","category":"Technology","primary_image_url":"https:\/\/s3.ap-southeast-1.amazonaws.com\/images.asianage.com\/images\/aa-Cover-jpgidqlmjlt8ue8b24bcufedn6-20190701102021.jpeg","primary_image_width":400,"primary_image_height":224,"secondary_image_url":null,"secondary_image_width":0,"secondary_image_height":0,"publisher":"Unavailable","publisher_domain":"Unavailable"}

(Photo: AFP)  A rocket developed by iSpace put satellites into orbit after a launch from a state facility in northwestern China on Thursday, marking the first successful orbital launch by a privately funded Chinese firm.  iSpace's Hyperbola-1 rocket blasted off from the Jiuquan Satellite Launch Centre at 1 p.m. (0500 GMT) Thursday, sending two satellites and payloads into a predetermined orbit, the company said in a statement on its official Wechat account.  The successful orbital launch was preceded by two failures since late last year by other startups.  Beijing-based Landspace attempted to deliver a satellite into orbit in October 2018 but failed. In late March this year, a rocket developed by OneSpace also failed to reach orbit.  Tens of private Chinese space companies have joined a race in recent years to develop rockets capable of delivering low-cost micro-satellites with commercial applications, backed by mostly Chinese venture capital.  In May 2018, OneSpace became the first private firm to send an independently developed rocket into space. That was followed by successful suborbital launches by iSpace four months later.  The next step was to send a payload into orbit, which is partly inspired by the recent technological success of US firms, such as SpaceX and Blue Origin.  The State Council, or cabinet, said in a white paper in December 2016 the space industry was an important part of China's overall development strategy.  One of China's near-term tasks is to develop major satellite systems of remote sensing, communications and broadcasting, and navigation and positioning.  President Xi Jinping has made becoming a space flight superpower a priority for the government since coming to office in 2012. The government aims to send a permanent manned space station into orbit by around 2022.","tags":"china|TAG|technology|TAG|in other news|TAG|ispace","category":"Technology","primary_image_url":"https:\/\/s3.ap-southeast-1.amazonaws.com\/images.asianage.com\/images\/aa-Cover-tb6kspf4gfd5bg8l1ai8kaesq7-20190726144214.jpeg","primary_image_width":400,"primary_image_height":224,"secondary_image_url":null,"secondary_image_width":0,"secondary_image_height":0,"publisher":"Unavailable","publisher_domain":"Unavailable"}

So if and when Xiaomi releases the Poco F2, which could be in the latter half of the year, expect the price to go down, but the number of features with it.  Camera  The phone will likely stick to a dual camera setup on the back, with one camera being the main sensor while another acts as the depth sensor or maybe even the wide angle lens.  Display  The phone may go back to the LCD screens and ditch the OLED panels found on the K20 phones, which are more expensive. But since the trend is for OLED Panels, which offer better viewing experiences compared to regular LCD screens and also consume lesser power, we could even see a low resolution OLED panel on the Poco F2.  Design  The Poco F2 might stick to the polycarbonate construction from the Poco F1, which is not just cheap but also very durable. How the design would look with a polycarbonate shell on remains to be seen as devices sporting the material may look anywhere between boring to absolutely stunning.  Other changes  The company may also make other changes like ditching the Infrared Face Unlock found on the Poco F1 and the 27W fast charging on the K20 series. The company may also go with alternatives to Corning's Gorilla Glass like the Dragontail Glass.  But considering the fact that consumers are now living in an era where even budget phones are striking the perfect balance between compromising on and adding features to make great devices, the toned down Poco F2. And according to recent reports, we might even see the end of the sub-brand before or after the launch of the rumoured Poco F2.  The bigger problem  Perhaps the biggest factor behind a possible discontinuation of the Poco series is their Product head Jay Mani parting ways with Xiaomi. Mani worked with Xiaomi for five years during which he became the product head for Poco and made a super successful sub-brand that offered a powerful phone at a cheap price.  The Poco F1 launched near the end of August last year. If the F2 is on its way, it is a good chance that we get to see the device in about a month from now. Whether or not Mani's quitting the company affects the existence of the Poco F2 will probably be revealed by then.","tags":"poco f2|TAG|mobiles & tabs|TAG|technology|TAG|xiaomi|TAG|jai mani|TAG|poco","category":"Technology","primary_image_url":"https:\/\/s3.ap-southeast-1.amazonaws.com\/images.asianage.com\/images\/aa-Cover-u155p28lb0vs2ed4ajl84cl276-20180827103122.jpeg","primary_image_width":400,"primary_image_height":224,"secondary_image_url":null,"secondary_image_width":0,"secondary_image_height":0,"publisher":"Unavailable","publisher_domain":"Unavailable"}

The 2019 iPhone 11 is coming in September and whatever people may say, Apple will make it look good; square stove-top camera hump and all. However, the 2020 iPhone 12 seems to be the more alluring option as it will come with revolutionary features that will make it a must-buy handset. And now, out of nowhere, Apple has made its intentions clear that the 202 iPhone is something it will take very seriously as they have recently acquired a major portion of Intel's chip business and in the process cracked up the excitement level to maximum.  As per an official statement, Apple has recently confirmed the USD 1 billion acquisition of a majority of Intel's smartphone modem business and it is expected to radically change the upcoming iPhones. As per a report by Reuters, Intel's head of networking Sandra Rivera stated that its 5G modems would start shipping to customers later on in 2019 with \u201cproducts in the market\u201d by 2020. It's worth mentioning that Apple is the sole customer of Intel chips and they have been surprisingly forthcoming with information.  As per a related report by Forbes, Apple's Senior VP of hardware technologies Johny Srouji has emphasised the alignment with already exists between the two companies and stated it will \u201chelp expedite our development on future products and allow Apple to further differentiate moving forward.\u201d  So this means that Apple already owns 5G modems for smartphones which will definitely be ready in 2020 and it gives Apple the opportunity to \u201c'expedite development on future products'. Apple's in-house chip manufacturing business is unparalleled. And Forbes states, \u201cIt only takes one look at the company's class-leading A Series chipsets, which consistently outperform Qualcomm's Snapdragons in both performance and efficiency, to see where this may lead. \u201c  Of course Apple is also playing it smart as in April it inked a modem deal with Qualcomm and thereby relieving pressure on Apple to supply millions of 5G modems that's required for its 2020 iPhones. If problems arise, Qualcomm can surely handle the demand. If that's not the case, then Apple can share the supply with Qualcomm and itself after which it will ease its rival out in future generation iPhones.  Forbes states, \u201cApple's deal gives the company its favourite thing: autonomy. The same autonomy it craved from Intel and Qualcomm when it made the A-Series chipset and from Google when it created Apple Maps. Conversely, Android rivals are now more reliant on Qualcomm than ever. That's why Qualcomm is likely to be cheering the Apple\/Intel deal: Android phones are now largely at the mercy of one supplier.\u201d  So while the 2019 iPhone line-up may not be the most exciting release in years, it has its roadmap planned out with the impending arrival of its own 5G modems in 2020. Pair this with a radical new display design and its full-screen Touch ID, the 2020 iPhone seems to be a blockbuster in the making.","tags":"mobiles & tabs|TAG|technology|TAG|2020 iphone|TAG|smartphones|TAG|apple","category":"Technology","primary_image_url":"https:\/\/s3.ap-southeast-1.amazonaws.com\/images.asianage.com\/images\/aa-Cover-jpgidqlmjlt8ue8b24bcufedn6-20190723100554.jpeg","primary_image_width":400,"primary_image_height":224,"secondary_image_url":null,"secondary_image_width":0,"secondary_image_height":0,"publisher":"Unavailable","publisher_domain":"Unavailable"}

The performance of wearables is of paramount importance as it is way more than just a fancy accessory. It is a fitness device which you expect to output accurate results uniformly across all races. Monitoring your heart rate is one such measurement that has the potential to save lives. A recent report by Stat alleges that some of the world's most popular wearables from brands such as Fitbit, Samsung and others do not accurately measure the heart rates of people of colour. This is due to its reliance on green lights that are easily absorbed by darker skin tones.  Stat claims that wearables utilize green LED lights to optically measure heart rates and can usually work across various skin tones if the LEDs are strong enough or can be complemented by an alternate heart rate sensor on the device. However, in some rare instances, these green LEDs are underpowered as well as unassisted that leads to inaccurate measurements for users with darker skins.  As per a related report by VentureBeat, \u201cThe potential for skin-related heart rate inaccuracies in some wearables was scientifically established in a 2017 Journal of Personalized Medicine study that found greater and statistically significant error rates in the Fitbit Surge, Samsung Gear, and second-generation Basis Peak with darker skin-toned users. By comparison, the study found that the then-current Apple Watch had the lowest overall error in heart rate measurement, likely due to its use of both bright green and infrared heart sensors.\u201d  Even though the report singles out brands such as Fitbit, Samsung, Garmin and Basis, they also point out that these issues are model-specific and in some cases, they may have even been rectified in more recent wearables from the aforementioned brands. The report states, \u201cFor instance, the report leads with a description of how heart rate measurements from Fitbit's Charge HR appeared to be inaccurate for one user of colour and his friends but notes that Fitbit currently says it's using \u201cgreen light at sufficient strength\u201d to enable \u201cthe optimum, most consistent performance for users of all skin tones.\u201d The latest Apple Watches \u2014 and some new competitors \u2014 are adding ECG measurement abilities, which will improve accuracy.\u201d  The report claims that users who have darker skin tones can reduce these heart-rate monitoring inaccuracies by purchasing newer wearables from reputable companies and avoid reliance on cheap, commodity green sensors.","tags":"technology|TAG|gadgets|TAG|fitbit|TAG|smartwatch|TAG|samsung|TAG|wearables","category":"Technology","primary_image_url":"https:\/\/s3.ap-southeast-1.amazonaws.com\/images.asianage.com\/images\/aa-Cover-t4gqve4a98n1kd32l1n6b6icd7-20161215173624.jpeg","primary_image_width":400,"primary_image_height":224,"secondary_image_url":null,"secondary_image_width":0,"secondary_image_height":0,"publisher":"Unavailable","publisher_domain":"Unavailable"}

Reports suggest that the 40mm version will come with a 1.2-inch 360 x 360 Super AMOLED display covered with Gorilla Glass and come loaded with a 247mAh battery. It is said to weigh a mere 31g. The 44mm version will get a 1.4-inch 360 x 360 Super AMOLED display that's protected by Gorilla Glass and feature a 340mAh battery. It will weigh 36g.  These smartwatches will come with a homegrown Samsung Exynos 9110 processor and feature 768MB of RAM. The higher-end LTE variant will come with 1.5GB of RAM. AS far as features go, it will now come with the groundbreaking interactive touch bezel that will respond to gestures for navigation. This feature will set it apart from anything else in the industry so far.  The report states, \u201cIt has also been revealed that the pair of smartwatches will now use Bluetooth 5.0. This could bring some marked improvements to the Galaxy Watch Active 2. Bluetooth 5.0 has a range up to four times the distance as Bluetooth 4.2 which was used in the first Galaxy Watch Active. It also makes it possible to pair two Bluetooth audio devices at once and uses less power than older Bluetooth standards.\u201d  Lastly, the Samsung Galaxy Watch Active 2 will come in aluminium and stainless steel finishes in Black or Silver. There will also be a special Pink Gold edition that will come with an aluminium finish while a Gold variant will be available in stainless steel. The GPS\/Bluetooth variant will be available in with finish; however, the LTE option will come in only stainless steel.","tags":"smartwatches|TAG|technology|TAG|samsung galaxy watch active2|TAG|galaxy watch|TAG|gadgets|TAG|samsung|TAG|galaxy watch active2","category":"Technology","primary_image_url":"https:\/\/s3.ap-southeast-1.amazonaws.com\/images.asianage.com\/images\/aa-Cover-l8uufh59rr68jaaqhgvht9ld34-20190525133809.jpeg","primary_image_width":400,"primary_image_height":224,"secondary_image_url":null,"secondary_image_width":0,"secondary_image_height":0,"publisher":"Unavailable","publisher_domain":"Unavailable"}

US delivery firm FedEx sued the American government last month after the company's mishandling of Huawei packages caused a public uproar in China.(Photo: AP)  Electronics manufacturer Flex held up goods worth some 700 million yuan (USD 101.85 million) of its Chinese client Huawei Technologies for more than a month after Washington put Huawei on a trade blacklist, China's Global Times reported on Thursday.  Flex kept the Huawei assets in its factory in the southern city of Zhuhai after Washington added Huawei to an Entity List on May 16 that prohibits US firms from doing business with it, according to the report.  Flex, which is dual-headquartered in the United States and Singapore and manufactures smartphone and 5G base stations for Huawei, did not immediately respond to an email seeking comment outside US business hours and did not answer calls to its Zhuhai office.  Guo Fulin, president of international media affairs at Huawei, told Reuters the company has retrieved some 400 million yuan of goods after negotiations with Flex last month and is still trying to get back the rest.  \u201cWe cannot understand why their Chinese factory seized our goods. This is an over-interpretation of the ban,\u201d he said.  The Chinese newspaper said Flex has been removed from Huawei's supply chain due to the incident that had \u201cangered Huawei\u201d, but Guo declined to comment on that.  In May, Huawei was added to the Entity List on national security grounds which barred it from buying US goods and services. According to a Goldman Sachs estimate here, Huawei contributed nearly 2.5 billion yuan, or 5 percent of Flex's total revenue in the third quarter of 2018.  While Washington has given Huawei a temporary reprieve from the ban and US President Donald Trump signaled he could be relaxing the curbs, it has already rattled the global technology supply chain tied to Huawei's USD 105 billion business that spans telecom equipment and smartphones.  The ban has also caused confusion among global companies and even academic bodies as the restrictions on their engagement with Huawei were unclear. US delivery firm FedEx sued the American government last month after the company's mishandling of Huawei packages caused a public uproar in China.","tags":"technology|TAG|in other news|TAG|huawei|TAG|flex","category":"Technology","primary_image_url":"https:\/\/s3.ap-southeast-1.amazonaws.com\/images.asianage.com\/images\/aa-Cover-l8uufh59rr68jaaqhgvht9ld34-20190521105141.jpeg","primary_image_width":400,"primary_image_height":224,"secondary_image_url":null,"secondary_image_width":0,"secondary_image_height":0,"publisher":"Unavailable","publisher_domain":"Unavailable"}

Amazon's profit inched up to USD 2.6 billion in the quarter, short of USD 2.8 billion that analysts were expecting. (Photo: ANI)  Amazon.com Inc on Thursday reported its first profit miss in two years and said income would slump in the current quarter, as the online retailer ramps up spending on one-day delivery to spark sales growth.  The company also said its investment in faster shipping was starting to pay off, with revenue rising 20 per cent to USD 63.4 billion in the second quarter ended in June. That topped analysts' estimates and the 17 per cent rate of growth that Amazon posted in April.  Shares fell more than 1 per cent in after-hours trade.  Seattle-based Amazon has drawn more than 100 million paid subscribers to its loyalty club Prime by releasing original TV shows, equipping more gadgets with its voice assistant Alexa and offering quick shipping for countless goods, including groceries from its subsidiary Whole Foods Market.  Now, it is investing heavily to halve delivery times to one day for Prime members, to stay ahead of rivals such as Walmart Inc that have marketed two-day shipping without subscription fees. So far Amazon has expanded one-day delivery to more than 10 million items, a fraction of the 100 million-plus goods it offers in two days in the United States.  The cost slightly exceeded the USD 800 million Amazon had forecast it would spend on the initiative in the second quarter, Chief Financial Officer Brian Olsavsky said on a call with reporters.  \u201cRight now we are seeing an increasing and ramping cost penalty, and that's what's built into the Q3 guidance,\u201d Olsavsky said, adding that most of the work to roll out single-day delivery outside the United States lies ahead of the company.  Amazon's profit inched up to USD 2.6 billion in the quarter, short of USD 2.8 billion that analysts were expecting, according to IBES data from Refinitiv. Operating expenses had jumped about 21 per cent.  The money Amazon is sinking into delivery shows how the world's largest online retailer is not immune to competition, said Neil Saunders, managing director at research firm GlobalData.  \u201cIt is a necessary evil,\u201d Saunders said. \u201cAmazon exists in a world where a lot of retailers have the advantage of allowing customers to pick things up the same day in stores,\u201d with far larger brick-and-mortar footprints than Amazon can boast.  SLOWING CLOUD?  Amazon's slowing revenue growth has in part reflected the evolving nature of its business. The company is gradually moving away from low-margin retail toward a marketplace model where it collects lucrative fees for helping other merchants on its site ship and advertise their products.  Revenue from seller services grew 23 per cent to USD 12.0 billion in the second quarter, while ad and other sales increased 37 per cent to USD 3.0 billion.  Though profitable, the dual retail and marketplace model has drawn scrutiny. Earlier this month, the European Commission launched an antitrust probe into whether Amazon's use of other merchants' data offered an unfair advantage to its retail unit, which has made private-label versions of popular products.  The US Justice Department also said Tuesday it would look into whether Big Tech engaged in any anticompetitive practices, including in online retail.  Olsavsky declined to discuss the matter.  At the same time, sales growth for Amazon's cloud unit fell below 40 per cent for the first time in years. The unit, which handles data storage and computing operations for other enterprises, raked in USD 8.4 billion in revenue in the second quarter, or 37 per cent more than the year prior. Nascent competitor Google (GOOGL.O) on Thursday reported a doubling of cloud revenue to about USD 2 billion, from its last disclosure of USD 1 billion at the end of 2017.  CFO Olsavsky said Amazon Web Services' revenue was strong, though sales cycles fluctuate depending on the timing of customers' migration to the cloud.  \u201cWe're growing faster than anyone\u201d on a dollar basis, he said.  Still, that is not sufficient to cover the stepped-up investments that Amazon has planned for this year. It now is gearing up for the winter holiday shopping season. It is expanding a variety of its US services globally. And it has beefed up AWS sales staff and overall marketing, which included a live-streamed concert with pop star Taylor Swift to promote its summer \u201cPrime Day\u201d sale.  These bets and others further afield, like its recent investments in electric and self-driving car companies, show how Amazon has been happy to forgo short-term income for long-term gains. The company for years had been known for rollercoaster profits.  Overall for the third quarter, Amazon said it expects operating income between USD 2.1 billion and USD 3.1 billion, versus USD 3.7 billion the year prior. Analysts were expecting USD 4.4 billion, according to analytics firm FactSet.","tags":"technology|TAG|in other news|TAG|amazon|TAG|amazon prime","category":"Technology","primary_image_url":"https:\/\/s3.ap-southeast-1.amazonaws.com\/images.asianage.com\/images\/aa-Cover-jpgidqlmjlt8ue8b24bcufedn6-20190711080448.jpeg","primary_image_width":400,"primary_image_height":224,"secondary_image_url":null,"secondary_image_width":0,"secondary_image_height":0,"publisher":"Unavailable","publisher_domain":"Unavailable"}

Rating:  In its short existence, Realme has grown by leaps and bounds and has managed to capture a market that's ripe for the taking. It has managed to create a substantial niche for itself where rival brands such as Xiaomi is running rampant. While newish brands like Honor and Xiaomi are currently dominating in the sub Rs 20K price bracket, Realme has steadily posed a substantial threat to their dominance and even though they are just nine smartphones in, their sales record speaks volumes about their commitment to the discerning Indian consumer.  With its 10th smartphone, Realme has upped the ante and have decided to target big-name players such as OnePlus and the yet-to-be-announced Redmi K20 Pro aka the flagship killer. The Realme X is the company's tenth smartphone and boy does it come packing some insane features. Realme is no longer just content with the midrange segment, they are now thinking big and since bigger is always better; they have added a huge, beautiful 6.53-inch FHD+ OLED screen on the Realme X; which is, of course, the main highlight here. If you think that's it' then you are surely mistaken as they have added a massive 48MP primary sensor to add to its premium attributes. And you know what? That's not it either. There's also a zippy in-display fingerprint scanner sitting under this beautiful OLED screen which makes it a tantalizing option is given the amazing price it sells at.  Rarely has a smartphone at this cost managed to garner such excitement and the Realme X is proving that you don't need to shell out the big bucks to get flagship features. Having spent a few days with the Realme X, here are our unbiased thoughts on it.  Design, Build  Realme X is a stunner! We absolutely love the design here. Being 2019, a lot of smartphones nowadays come with a notch-less, no punch-hole and no almost bezel-less design. Leading the way with this design is the OnePlus 7 Pro, followed by the OPPO Reno 10x Zoom and trailing by not much in third place \u2014 the ASUS 6Z. Coming with a similar design trend is the Realme X and the only difference here is that this smartphone boasts a way more competitive price tag than the other three smartphones just mentioned. By negating any blemishes on the display such as a punch-hole or a notch, Realme has been able to achieve a near-bezel-less design that's grabbing all the attention these days.  While three sides of the Realme X come with almost no frame, the chin found here is a bit on the thicker side. However, no points docked off Realme for adding this thick bottom bezel as some compromises need to be made in order to achieve this competitive pricing.  Another exciting feature of the Realme X is the inclusion of an in-display fingerprint scanner and this is made possible because of the OLED display used here. The poisoning is absolutely perfect which allows for easy single-handed biometric authentication. Do note that this is of the optical variety and not like the ultrasonic type used on the Samsung Galaxy S10 smartphones. While it may not be as secure as Samsung's option; it is a speedy customer and manages to unlock the Realme X a lot faster in comparison to unlocking the Galaxy S10 \u2014 which is painfully slow.  Realme has added a neat feature here which allows you to unlock the X when it detects any movement; also, it can be activated whenever you wake the device. We found the raise to wake a more convenient option than keeping it turned off till the X is woken with the power button. The Goodix G2.4 in-display scanner is really fast; maybe not the fastest out there but definitely faster than earlier renditions of in-display scanners.  Since the Realme X doesn't come with a notch or punch-hole cut-out, the front-facing camera is hidden in the body and uses a pop-up style elevated selfie camera to get the job done. This selfie camera is located bang in the centre and not to the side like some of its rivals. This motorized pop-up camera takes a mere 0.74 seconds to extend and rides out at over 2,00,000 times allowing you to activate it up to 50 times a day, every day for a span of 10 years. If that's not an assurance of the highest order then we don't know what is. Additionally, like OnePlus' option, the pop-up camera retracts when it detects that it has been dropped which helps in keeping it safe from any accidental spills.  Realme has added a slit on the top of the display to house the earpiece and we find this design absolutely clean. Unfortunately, the only feature lacking here is a notification LED. Several brands have managed to fit this feature in the earpiece; but with the Realme X, we find no such luck. The top of the device also features the secondary microphone which assists with clearer sound.  Moving on to the rear, the Realme X comes with a centre-aligned dual-camera setup that sits almost flush with the body. Both cameras and flash are located in this minimal hump and when kept flat on a table, there is hardly any wobble whatsoever.  Available in two colour options \u2014 Punk Blue and Steam White, the Realme X is a classy handset whichever way you look at it. In for testing we received the former model and we fell in love with it as soon as we unboxed it. The Punk Blue variant has a gradient design that shifts aesthetically from Purple to Blue and even though gradient designs are nothing new, adding it on a flagship handset has its own charm which is well appreciated. Interestingly, Realme has added the gradient design on the frame as well which is not a common sight as it adds to the smartphone's appeal.  The button positioning is similar to other Realme handsets with the power button located on the left and the volume rockers on the right. The SIM tray is located above the power button and a notable absentee here is the lack of a micro SD car slot. While it can use up to two nano-SIM cards, not having a microSD card is quite a miss.  Realme has added the unicorn feature \u2014 the 3.5mm audio jack which is rapidly getting displaced on flagship smartphones. Having a 3.5mm audio jack in 2019 is quite a big feature as brands such as OnePlus, Google and others have no place for it on their smartphones. The bottom also plays home to the USB Type-C port which is quite refreshing since it's now in the flagship segment and cannot get away with it since all their budget smartphones come with a micro USB port. In this area, we also find the speaker grille and microphone which rounds up all the essential features of any smartphone.  Although it may look it, the Realme X's rear is made out of plastic and not glass. This helps in keeping its weight down and more importantly to keep its price down.  Display  Being a flagship device, the Realme X is built with one of the best displays used in this price point. Coming with a 6.53-inch OLED display, this is the brand's first implementation of this premium technology. It has a 1080 x 2340 FHD+ resolution and a 19:5:9 ratio that's devoid of any notch. Realme has rated its brightness at 450 nits which is pretty spectacular and way ahead of the LCD displays that boast a less than stellar output. With it, content on the screen is viewable in most lighting conditions and even when used in direct sunlight there are no problems in deciphering anything on the display.  Coming with an OLED display, you get some of the deepest blacks there are which aid with the insane contrast levels \u2014 a good feature by any stretch. Out of the box, colours are great and have a punch that's found only on displays of this variety. Viewing videos and images on the Realme X are great and since it is slightly over saturated, it makes for a more enjoyable experience. Overall, the display is pretty great and gets full points across the board. However, when compared with the OnePlus 7 Pro, it does take a beating; but you have to keep in mind that the OnePlus flagship costs nearly Rs 50K which is in a category by itself.  Software  Coming with Color OS 6 that's based on Android Pie, this is the same OS used on other Realme handsets such as the Realme 3 and 3 Pro. There is the standard bloatware and a start-up pane offers you the choice to add some useful apps. These include Amazon, UC Browser, NewsPoint, WhatsApp, ShareChat, TikTok and more. You have a choice of not installing these apps and saving on space. However, these are pretty common apps which you will download sooner or later so it's best to add them while setting up the phone.  A beautiful feature of Color OS 6 is that it gives you the option to delete some of the preinstalled apps which you don't fancy. These apps are mostly similar to Google's apps and choosing to keep just Google's options will give you a rounded smartphone experience.  On the Realme X, there is an app drawer which you can quickly use to access apps according to alphabetical order. Also, you get an iOS-like interface with apps loaded across the different home screens which is also a comfortable way for accessing apps. The pull-down pane can be used to access notifications, quick settings, and brightness adjustment. In this page, you are greeted with options for Night Shield, Boost, Realme Share, Power Saver, Google Assistant and others.  Overall, Color OS 6 is very intuitive and way more refined than previous builds which make the learning curve negligible.  Performance  Probably the only things lacking on the Realme X is a flagship processor such as a Snapdragon 855 SoC. Realme has added an octa-core Snapdragon 710 chipset here which is quite confusing since they are gunning for flagships with the X. This chipset comes with either 4GB, 6GB or 8GB of RAM and paired with either 64GB or 128GB of RAM. The review unit we received is the 8GB\/128GB variant and even though it comes with a less than spectacular chipset, it still gave off decent performances.  Together, both the CPU and RAM manage to excel where performances are concerned. In gaming as well as multitasking, the Realme X is a strong performer and to enhance your gaming experience, you can switch on Game Space which will offer you uninterrupted gameplay. While testing, we did not notice any overheating or rapid battery drain.  While running benchmarks such as Geekbench, the Realme X performed as expected from a handset running a Snapdragon 710 SoC. The single-core score recorded was 1459 points while the multi-core score was 5868 points.  When it came to consuming multimedia, the bright and punch colours of the OLED display proved to be the deciding factor here; however, you are restricted to the standard definition here and not HD content as the Realme X is not Widevine L1 certified. However, this by no means takes away your enjoyable video streaming experience.  Camera  The Realme X comes with a 48MP (f\/1.7) Sony IMX586 primary sensor on the rear which is arguably the best out there. Assisting it is a 5MP depth sensor that aids with portrait shots. In order to achieve the best possible images in low-light environments, Realme has utilized pixel-binning technology that combines four pixels to one thereby effectively raising the pixel size to 1.6um that vastly enhances sensitivity.  The app for the camera is fast as it is intuitive and getting used to the different options takes a matter of seconds. The Expert Mode is essentially Realme's manual mode that allows you to adjust everything from exposure to white balance and so on. Other interesting modes found in the app include Nightscape, Slo-mo and Pano. In the main Photo mode, you can choose to have Chroma Boost on as well as HDR to always-on which will enhance the overall image quality. Additionally, like most smartphones out there, the Realme X comes with Beauty Mode, AI, filters and so on. The AI scene recognition is quick and is able to identify the various images on the viewfinder instantly.  While capturing images with the Realme X, pictures appeared almost natural with some over-saturation present giving your photos a nice pop of colour. In well-lit environments, colours were vivid and contrast levels were somewhat high. Details are present throughout and sharpness is preserved. Chroma Boost plays its part in enhancing the overall image quality and contributes to the overall colour pop. As a default, we opted for 12MP shooting and refrained from using the 48MP camera for most of our test shots as this is what will give you the best possible captures.  In low-light photography, images from the Realme X packed in a lot of detail with only some noise creeping in. During our testing, we observed colours appearing natural with the right amount of exposure. Throw in the Nightscape mode and you get images which are otherwise bright and enhanced due to the long exposure. This tool is great but doesn't expect Google Pixel level night shots here.  Realme uses a 16MP IMX471 sensor with an aperture of F\/2.0 for its front-facing the camera. Images captured with this snapper are one of the best you get on a smartphone at this price. Skin tones appear natural and we really appreciate the overall performance here. The edge-detection is great in portrait shots and overall, it gets a big thumbs up from us.  Battery  The Realme X comes with a 3765mAh battery that's not the biggest out there and in terms of capacity, it gets beaten by its competitors. However, it does come with VOOC (20W) flash charging support which will allow you to go from 0 to 55 per cent in a span of just 30 minutes and this is possible even while playing high-end games. The Realme X gets you a day and a half worth of use under heavy usage. We noticed that even while gaming, streaming videos and accessing Instagram, the battery still had enough in the tank to take you over to half of the next day.  Verdict  The Realme X is priced at Rs 19,999 for the 8GB\/128GB while the lower-end variant, the 4GB\/128GB costs Rs 16,999 in India. It is designed to perfection even though it isn't built with the most premium materials. With this handset, Realme is proving that it is time for them to step up from dominating the middling Rs 20K segment and tackle the premium mid-range. The Realme X is the ideal handset that can blow this segment wide open as it comes with high-end features such as notch-less OLED display with a wonderful pop-up camera, a beastly 48MP rear snapper and a very capable battery.  Overall, the Realme X is a handset that's a flagship killer's killer and this is looking at you Redmi K20 Pro.","tags":"smartphone|TAG|mobiles & tabs|TAG|technology|TAG|review|TAG|realme x","category":"Technology","primary_image_url":"https:\/\/s3.ap-southeast-1.amazonaws.com\/images.asianage.com\/images\/aa-Cover-jpgidqlmjlt8ue8b24bcufedn6-20190715133456.jpeg","primary_image_width":400,"primary_image_height":224,"secondary_image_url":null,"secondary_image_width":0,"secondary_image_height":0,"publisher":"Unavailable","publisher_domain":"Unavailable"}

The Apple iPhone 11 will be launching in September and with it, we are going to be getting a partially redesigned handset with some important changes that will pave the way for future iPhones. To the rear, we get the biggest change and it will now come with a colour-matched square camera bump that's been receiving harsh criticisms ever since it first leaked. The stovetop design will slot in three rear sensors as opposed to two on the iPhone XS and will come with two camera sensors on the back for the iPhone 11R as opposed to one on the iPhone XR.  Though this will be a new handset, it is similar to what Apple did with the iPhone 7 and added interesting features that made it a worthy upgrade over the iPhone 6S. The iPhone 11 appears to have a similar strategy as the iPhone 7 and it's simply more than an 'S' variant. Apart from the added sensor on the rear, all other changes will be internal; so, the face will look similar to the iPhone XS and the iPhone X that came before it.  The Apple iPhone 11 will pave the way for the 2020 iPhone 12 as it will come with a redesigned logic board as opposed to the iPhone XS. Other minor changes include a redesigned mute switch, which is something similar to what Apple uses on its iPads.  Taking all this bit of information, a graphic designer who goes by the name 'Prospection' has created a video that depicts what the iPhone 11 will look like once it has been launched. Unlike previous renders, there are no mistakes here and the designer hasn't taken any liberties by adding features that will not feature in the iPhone 11. The end result is a stunning handset that's worthy of being the iPhone XS' successor and a flagship in its own standing.  Check out the video below and let us know your thoughts about it in the comments section.","tags":"mobiles & tabs|TAG|technology|TAG|iphone 11|TAG|smartphones|TAG|apple|TAG|concept","category":"Technology","primary_image_url":"https:\/\/s3.ap-southeast-1.amazonaws.com\/images.asianage.com\/images\/aa-Cover-jpgidqlmjlt8ue8b24bcufedn6-20190726090514.jpeg","primary_image_width":400,"primary_image_height":224,"secondary_image_url":null,"secondary_image_width":0,"secondary_image_height":0,"publisher":"Unavailable","publisher_domain":"Unavailable"}

Rating:  Ever since the Apple Watch was launched, the wearables market was blown wide open. Like its iPhones and iPads, the Cupertino-based smartphone giant has enjoyed a monopoly in the smartwatch segment. While brands have continued to announce its Apple Watch rivals, very few brands have managed to walk the fine line between price and features.  Samsung has not had a great time in the wearables space and they continue to be trounced by Apple with every passing edition. This year, Samsung has doubled-down on its smartwatch and have launched the Galaxy Watch Active that is positioned as a fitness device yet boasting features that not just compete but also surpass every other brand when it comes to pricing, design and functionality.  The Samsung Galaxy Watch Active has finally been launched in India after debuting in various markets the world over. This product is uniquely positioned as it sits below the Samsung Galaxy Watch, the brand's premium wearable that's arguably one of the best smartwatches in the world right now. The Active is a 'lite' variant of this flagship smartwatch that packs fewer features, an affordable price tag of just Rs 19,990 and a smaller overall design.  Is this a worthy alternative to the Apple Watch 3 and does it have enough of scope to disrupt the wearables segment? Read on to find out more.  Design, Build  Apple has stuck with the square design on its Watch series and Samsung in a bid, not to ape it's arch-rival has continued to launch its smartwatches with a circular design. This rounded display is a common trait for Android wearables and Samsung have continued to use it on the Galaxy Watch Active. To add a bit of sporty appeal to it, the Galaxy Watch Active doesn't come with a rotating bezel which according to me is a bit of a miss as it would have elevated its position quite drastically. However, being a budget device, we can ignore this feature as it is by no means a make or break addition.  By eliminating the rotating bezel, Samsung has managed to keep the weight down to quite a large extent and this has worked it their favour as it feels extremely comfortable to use for large periods of time without any wrist fatigue. Also, without this feature, the Galaxy Watch Active appears thinner, stylish and without compromising on its premium appearance.  As stated earlier, the rotating bezel is a miss as it allowed me, as a power-user to access content a lot quicker. As there isn't any bezel here, you are forced to swipe across the display. This takes a bit getting used to if you come from a previous Samsung smartwatch; however, in time, I found that the swipes are quite intuitive and scrolling through the various options becomes second nature.  Though the Galaxy Watch Active comes with a budget-friendly price tag, it is by no means a cheaply constructed device. It is built of premium materials such as metal and looks and feels extremely high-end. I appreciated the fact that it comes with a completely simple design and the only notable attributes are the two buttons that are located on the right at the two and four positions. While the buttons take a bit of getting acquainted with to locate due to its almost flush nature; I found that it takes just a matter of days to completely get adjusted to them.  The pride and glory of the Samsung Galaxy Watch Active is the 1.1-inch (2.81cm) 360 x 360 resolution Super AMOLED display that features a colour depth of 16 million colours. If you have used wearables from other brands in the past, say for example the Samsung Galaxy Watch or Apple Watch, you will find the size of this display to be a bit limited as it is rather small. It looks especially tiny on a male's wrist but suits most female's wrists perfectly.  With that being said, if this is your first smartwatch, you won't find any issues here and getting used to it takes just a matter of time. Also, the display is completely usable and though it's tinier than most smartwatches I have used before, I found that navigating through the different menus completely doable. The screen is bright, crisp and text is legible on this full-coloured Tizen smartwatch. This is mainly in part due to the excellent Samsung display used here. Even in direct sunlight content on the screen is discernible and using it is an absolute pleasure.  Being classified as a fitness smartwatch, the Active is also water-proof to an extent and it boasts the ingress protection certification of IP68 which allows you to submerge it in water to a depth of 5-metres \u2014which is pretty impressive. This allows you to take it for a swim and record some laps as it also comes with a swim tracking feature.  Lastly, the Samsung Galaxy Watch Active is available in four hues \u2014 Black, Green, Gold and Silver. The Gold variant is more of a pinkish colour which in my opinion looks pretty attractive. Samsung has added straps that feature the same colour as the dial and you can purchase additional straps from the brand or from third-party manufacturers.  Like the Apple Watch, the Galaxy Watch comes with silicone straps which is extremely comfortable to wear even when you're in the middle of some hard-core workouts. Due to the extremely lightweight nature of the watch, you don't even realize it's on your wrist. But it keeps on powering through; all while outputting every task it's undertaking.  Overall, while the Samsung Galaxy Watch Active is a bit small for my liking, I found the design and build quite appealing that would make me recommend this smartwatch over the Apple option; if you have an Android smartphone.  Software  Google Wear OS is rapidly gaining popularity the world over; however, Samsung chose to use its own homebrewed Tizen OS with the Galaxy Watch Active. This is the latest version here and unlike a few years ago, this Samsung OS has a lot going for it in terms of functionality. While it isn't as expansive as Apple's WatchOS, it's still pretty intuitive and makes the Active's experience quite immersive.  The Galaxy Watch with the Tizen OS is simple to use and easy to understand. The widgets are customizable and you can even adjust the order they are displayed in. Due to the amazing quality of the screen and the super-intuitive Tizen OS, just simple taps or swipes will allow you to navigate through each and every option. Past notifications can be accessed by moving left from the home screen while the different watch widgets can be accessed while scrolling right. That's it! Everything is this simple and I appreciate Samsung for making it this easy to operate and not giving the Galaxy Watch Active a steep learning curve.  I used the Galaxy Watch Active with an iPhone due to the lack of a Samsung device and I found that every notification that came through the phone was shown on the smartwatch ahead of it appearing on the iPhone. While it's great that the watch displays every single notification, it can't do much more than reading it out. There isn't any way for you to interact with it.  To quickly access all your apps, all you need to do is tap the lower button and you're greeted with the quick menu that displays all your apps you've installed. While it is functional, if the watch had a rotating bezel, it would have worked a lot better. Because of the lack of a rotating bezel, you'll have to tap on individual apps to gain access to it; which isn't a problem and quite easy to do.  Some of the notable apps that come preinstalled include a heart rate monitor, breathing exercises, workouts, weather, reminders, workout challenges, sleep tacker, world clock and more. This is a full-fledged smartwatch that doesn't come with a hefty price tag.  Apart from this, Samsung also has wide access to third-party apps that can be downloaded through the Galaxy Watch app on your smartphone. The Galaxy Store has a few apps that have become a necessity of a smartwatch such as Spotify or Run with Map my Run. As of now, the number of apps available for Tizen OS isn't that vast; but it's a consolation knowing that the marketplace is expanding and different essential apps are constantly being added.  Performance  The Galaxy Watch Active is fitted with an Exynos 9110 chipset which is a home-grown Samsung SoC that's of the high-end variety. It comes with a dual-core processor that's clocked at 1.15GHz which is pretty impressive for a wearable. This processor is paired with 750MB of ARM and 4GB of storage. After the software installation, you get 1.5GB of available storage for adding apps and music; which isn't quite a lot if you have a huge collection of music.  The configuration of the RAM and processor allow for a speedy device and I have noticed it be on par with the Apple Watch 4 and the Galaxy Watch; two smartwatches that cost quite a bit more than the Galaxy Watch Active.  Pulling up apps load extremely fast and they are as fast as rival smartwatches. I never noticed any lag or stutter at all during my entire testing period and the Active worked as advertised.  Additionally, the music stored on the watch can be played by pairing Bluetooth earphones which negates the need for a smartphone. This allows you to just wear your Active and your favourite pair of Bluetooth earphones and go for a run or any workout all while leaving your smartphone at home \u2014 which is pretty convenient if you ask me.  The only downside here is that it doesn't come with an LTE version and this is where it loses out to the Apple Watch as you can't receive calls or stream music through an internet connection when you leave your phone at home. However, with the Galaxy Watch Active priced this aggressively, I don't miss the LTE connection a single bit.  Fitness features  Being a smartwatch in 2019, it has to come with an impressive list of fitness features. While it isn't packed to the brim like the Apple Watch Series 4 with its ECG monitor and fall detection, the Galaxy Watch Active is no pushover. It has a heart rate monitor which is a standard for every wearable these days as well as having the ability to calculate your stress levels. The Active can easily detect spikes in heart rate and provide you with ways to ease your stress levels by calming yourself with breathing exercises. I used a number of breathing exercises after getting prompted by the Active and found it to be quite beneficial for my health and state of mind. I found them to be quite relaxing and I would urge anyone who purchases this watch to indulge in this feature a few times a day. This is highly beneficial in keeping your stress levels down especially in this rat race called life.  There are a bunch of exercises available in the workout widget that I found quite useful. While the common ones such as running, cycling, hiking, etc. are included, it also has specific weight training workouts that use the various sensors to measure your activities. These were more or less accurate and it was usually off by one or two reps which aren't a deal-breaker. After completing your workout, the statistics are available in your iOS or Android app after your device has been synced. This is quite useful as it helps you with your overall fitness goals.  A neat addition here is the sleep tracker that provides metrics for REM, as well as record your sleep cycle. It's a great app and kudos to Samsung for including it straight out of the box. Also, with two-day battery life, you can easily wear this watch and let it do the needful every night without needing to place it on the charger every single night to top up the battery.  Battery  As mentioned earlier, the Samsung Galaxy Watch Active comes with impressive two-day battery life. The 230mAh battery is rated at 45 hours and during my extensive testing period, I noticed it to last just short of two whole days. With that being said, battery life is a subjective feature and it will depend on person-to-person usage. While I would say that it offered an approximate 48-hours on a single charge, I feel `with limited usage and little to no fiddling around, you could stretch it to about three days; which by the way is pretty excellent for a smartwatch.  Additionally, there's a low battery mode that kicks in when your battery is nearing empty which is around the 20 per cent mark. If this mode is turned on, you can milk the battery for quite a considerable amount of time till you place it back on its charger.  Speaking of charger, the Galaxy Watch Active comes with a charging pad that's slightly larger than the Apple Watch option and to top up the 230mAh battery, it took about 1 hour 50 minutes.  Also, the Galaxy Watch Active works with other Qi wireless chargers such as the Samsung Wireless Battery Pack or smartphones with bilateral wireless charging capabilities such as the Galaxy S10.  Verdict  The Samsung Galaxy Watch Active is priced at Rs 19,990 in India and it is by far one of the best smartwatches in the world at this cost. If you own an Android smartphone and don't want to break the bank by purchasing the Galaxy Watch which costs Rs 10,000 more, then the Active is an amazing choice for you. Additionally, Samsung has added a ton of features here which make it not just rival but beat the Apple Watch Series 3 hands-down; thereby making it a must-buy smartwatch not just in the Rs 20K price bracket but also in the sub Rs 28K price bracket.  With that being said, Samsung is preparing to launch a new smartwatch which is the successor to the Galaxy Watch Active \u2014the Samsung Galaxy Watch Active2. This upcoming watch will come with interesting features that will give each and every smartwatch out there a run for its money as it will boast features that will rival the Apple Watch 4 such as ECG reading and fall detection. While the launch date of this option is just around the corner, it is unknown when it will debut in India. This helps in providing the original Galaxy Watch with some breathing space and a chance to make its mark in a segment that's nascent and waiting to get disrupted.","tags":"technology|TAG|samsung galaxy watch active|TAG|gadgets|TAG|smartwatch|TAG|review","category":"Technology","primary_image_url":"https:\/\/s3.ap-southeast-1.amazonaws.com\/images.asianage.com\/images\/aa-Cover-jpgidqlmjlt8ue8b24bcufedn6-20190722115413.jpeg","primary_image_width":400,"primary_image_height":224,"secondary_image_url":null,"secondary_image_width":0,"secondary_image_height":0,"publisher":"Unavailable","publisher_domain":"Unavailable"}

And a good pair of headphones certainly have the power to take you in a world built by your own imagination, where you stay inspired, taking personal productivity to a whole new level.  Rating:  One thing we have learnt from existing times is that the present-day man comes with a smartphone and a pair of reliable state-of-the-art headphones. The modern man loves his music and hates compromising with quality whenever enjoying his personal space and time, always looking for the finest of avant-garde listening devices to fuel the yearning of music regardless of the genre, whether it be rock and roll, rap or hip-hop, Bollywood or disco; he does not want to trade-off with whatever you may give him to replace his 'me-time.'  And a good pair of headphones certainly have the power to take you into a world built by your own imagination, where you stay inspired, taking personal productivity to a whole new level.  Over the years we have witnessed all kinds of headphones coming and going from the market \u2014 wired ones, wireless ones, noise-cancelling ones, on-ear, over-ear and many that we are still to learn about. So, today I'll be introducing a pair of Bluetooth headphones which come equipped with voice assist technology. I had the opportunity to spend some time with the XECH A8 voice assist headphones and these are my honest thoughts on them.  Design and Build  The headphones come in a box just like any, loaded with useful accessories. The box contains an AUX cable for the headphone with a 3.5mm jack which can be used to connect the headphones with your handset, a micro USB charging cable for charging, an airplane audio adapter and an EVA carrying case. The carrying case is one of the bests available falling under this price range \u2014 very enduring and also attractive. It can easily withstand enough pressure to protect the headphones from any kind of physical damage.  Dressed in Black and Grey, the Xech A8 features a colour combination that's pretty common on headphones. Being really lightweight and weighing around 449 grams, they are made of PVC plastic, rubber, foam and artificial leather, generally, these are the most common materials used in an over-ear headphone. The lightweight design actually is a pro in long and extended sessions while using the headphones, making them very practical and efficient. And because of an over-ear design, it somewhat helps in passive noise-cancellation.  The navigation buttons are also made of plastic and they are placed on the right side on the front, the makers could've gone for a cleaner look by placing the buttons on the sides. The audio jack, microSD slot, USB charging port and the mic are placed on the side below the navigation buttons. The plastic buttons are quite responsive but again, in the long run, they probably won't make it.  On the ears, they are well cushioned but I feel that eventually, they will die out or maybe even get ruptured. The headband is made of soft plastic, a feature that dominates the design aspect of these headphones. For added comfort, there is a soft padding, the same type that's used on the ear cups. The XECH A8 is a budget headphone but still, on the physical front, the makers could've gone with better choices.  Performance  The XECH A8 here offers a decent audio quality experience, not so great but not so bad either, the word you are looking for is \u201cmediocre.\u201d For example, while listening to \u201cGoodbye Angels\u201d by RHCP, the bass did not have a punch. When altering the equalizer to have a maximum bass output, I had to strain my hearing for other frequencies and this was something I encountered with the headphones on each and every setting. The highs and the lows were totally unbalanced and they clearly did not complement each other. A good thing that I observed was no distortion of sound on full volume, both on my Android device and on my Windows 10 PC.  The best thing about the XECH A8 I found was its voice assistant feature which in my experience was bang-on accurate every time I used it. Under the Rs 3,000 segment, finding a voice-enabled headphone is a rarity and also this with so much of pin-point accuracy. The voice assist function supports Siri, Google Assistant, Bixby and Cortana.  The A8 features a standard 4.2 Bluetooth which works fluently up to a 10-meter range, going beyond this range is not suggested as it starts to lose connection with the device connected via Bluetooth. As per the specs, the headphones take around 2 hours to charge its 3.7V 300mAh rechargeable lithium-ion battery and charging it from dead to 100 per cent, it took around somewhere the same time as mentioned. And after a full charge, it went on for the next 5 hours or so.  Verdict  Priced for Rs 2,499, the XECH A8 voice assist headphones make an interesting choice in the market. However, in terms of build quality and audio quality, the makers of the A8 could've done a better execution. The audio still, is not disappointing but as said earlier, it is mediocre and needs setting it up as per your preferences.  The voice assist feature is the focus of attention, and that's why I would like to think of these as a multipurpose headphone which gives you the accessibility of using them and doing a lot more than just listening to music without using your hands. Along with everything, the super sturdy EVA carrying case won't let any harm come near to the headphones while travelling.","tags":"bluetooth|TAG|technology|TAG|gadgets|TAG|voice assistant|TAG|wireless headphones|TAG|xech a8","category":"Technology","primary_image_url":"https:\/\/s3.ap-southeast-1.amazonaws.com\/images.asianage.com\/images\/aa-Cover-ojv56jjh7ocajljksl3kemh2e1-20190628160205.jpeg","primary_image_width":400,"primary_image_height":224,"secondary_image_url":null,"secondary_image_width":0,"secondary_image_height":0,"publisher":"Unavailable","publisher_domain":"Unavailable"}

Rating:  When Xioami introduced the Mi soundbar earlier this year, it blew the market wide open with its fabulous pricing. Since then, not many manufacturers have been able to step up and pose a threat to its dominance; that is, until now.  Boult Audio, a brand that's steadily building a name for itself in India has recently launched the Bassbars A4 soundbar. Unlike most speakers of this type that have been around for a year, this model has the unique feature of being separated at its centre to convert into twin tower speakers. If any of you have heard a soundbar achieve this trick, raise your hand now.  Design, Build  The selling price of this home audio solution is a sure shot excuse to purchase the Bassbars. Seldom would you find an option from a reputable brand to be sold at such a competitive price. While the price is one of the motivating factors to purchase it, the design is the reason confirms that it's a must buy product.  The Boult Bassbars 2.0, which is what it is also called, comes with the unique feature of being a convertible speaker. In the past, we have seen tablets, laptops and other such tech that's convertible but never something quite like this in the home audio segment. Major ups to Boult for adding a product such as this in its repertoire.  In terms of appearance, Boult uses a pretty straight-forward design philosophy here as it comes with a black finish that fits in with most homes and can complement most televisions available. By coming in this colour, it automatically gives it an edge over the Mi Soundbar which just comes in a white colourway that's quite a dust and dirt magnet. That's not to say that this speaker doesn't attract dust; it just doesn't show as visibly.  Built with a combination of glossy black plastic and a metal grille, this speaker looks undeniably elegant and completely betrays its price tag. Even though this speaker is priced this competitively, it still looks as stylish as rivals that cost even up to twice the amount. When used as a soundbar, it measures about the size of a 42-inch television and while separated, it stands about one and a half foot high. Even though it looks great as a tower speaker, I preferred to use it as a soundbar as I felt it suited my living space better. However, the choice is completely up to you regarding this and it's great that you finally get a multi-option when it comes to a speaker system.  Like most soundbars available in the market, the physical connections happen on the reverse with their being inputs for power, a 3.5mm audio jack and RCA. Controls are located on the side and these include power, play\/pause, track adjustment and volume. Interestingly, Boult hasn't sacrificed on any other input features and have also included slots for USB and a TF card. All these ports and connections are located on the right speaker with the left being used as a tag along. When used as a single unit, both speakers are connected by a single short cable that makes it highly convenient. To use it as satellite speakers, there is a longer connector that's also bundled in the packaging.  Boult has added another surprise here with the Bassbars. Apart from being placed in front of the TV or as satellite speakers, this audio solution can also be wall mounted making it very versatile indeed.  Boult also throws in a remote control that adds a dose of convenience to your life and this is something we really appreciate here as it has a wide number of features that can be accessed without needing to physically get up from your comfortable position.  Performance  The Boult Audio Bassbars come with micro tweeters and subwoofers on each unit with its output rated at 40W. It comes with Bluetooth v4.2 with A2DP that offers a range of up to 10-metres from the audio source. While this option will mostly be paired with televisions, you can also use it with smartphones, tablets and laptops making it an all-around entertainment system for your home.  During the testing period, we paired it with an LG 42-inch television and various Android and iOS smartphones. The connection was strong throughout and even when used from a distance of slightly over 10-metres, the connection did not falter. This is one of the strong points of the Bassbars.  Being a soundbar, Boult Audio aims to emulate a 360-degree surround sound and the speakers do offer a cinematic experience as it adds to the overall movie watching experience. Coming with Dolby Digital Plus you do get a surround sound experience that's ideal for home theatre setups as it offers high-fidelity audio without high bandwidth needs for some lossless formats.  The audio quality is decent here and it does have a bass impact that's desirable and doesn't distort at even medium to high volumes. Highs have a reach here but better reproduction is found on rival models. Mids, on the other hand, do get drowned out at times; but not enough to ruin our experience. Overall, if you're looking for a casual speaker system that can complement your home, then this is a great choice; however, if you want an option that produces above average and stellar performances, there are other options available in the market.  Verdict  The Boult Bassbars A4 is priced at Rs 4,999 in India and for the number of features they have thrown in; it's well worth your cash. For a brand that has been expanding by leaps and bounds in these few years, the Bassbars is a great addition to its portfolio. Coming with great audio quality and a unique design that's completely versatile, Boult is now giving consumers the option to witness a new dimension of sound that will enhance their home theatre experience.","tags":"bassbars|TAG|boult audio|TAG|technology|TAG|speaker|TAG|gadgets|TAG|review","category":"Technology","primary_image_url":"https:\/\/s3.ap-southeast-1.amazonaws.com\/images.asianage.com\/images\/aa-Cover-l8uufh59rr68jaaqhgvht9ld34-20190630093903.jpeg","primary_image_width":400,"primary_image_height":224,"secondary_image_url":null,"secondary_image_width":0,"secondary_image_height":0,"publisher":"Unavailable","publisher_domain":"Unavailable"}
{"story_guid":"a31aa3386428c567__PUB_BY__asianage.com","title":"Samsung Galaxy M40 review: Power! Performance! Price!","pub_feed_url":"https:\/\/www.asianage.com\/rss_feed\/?subsectionId=99","destination_url":"https:\/\/www.asianage.com\/technology\/mobiles-tabs\/220619\/samsung-galaxy-m40-review-power-performance-price.html","text":"The Galaxy M40 is probably one of the hottest midrangers to launch this year and the brand has done well to cram all these features in.  Rating:  The year 2019 has been a rather special one for Samsung as they have managed to capture back a market that was slowly slipping away from its grasp. With the newly-formed M-Series of budget handsets, Samsung has managed to disrupt a segment in only the way that they know how. The M-Series handsets are critical masterpieces and Samsung's strategy of launching handsets in various segments has propelled them back to the summit. With this series of handsets, you get models like the M10 for selling as low as Rs 7,990 and right up to the M30 which goes as high as Rs 17,990.  In a move that literally came out of nowhere, Samsung recently launched the Galaxy M40, a smartphone that defies all expectations. It features a design that's similar to the flagship, Galaxy S10, a triple rear sensor and most notably it is placed in a price bracket where these specifications aren't common for a brand that boasts such a lofty reputation.  Having spent a few days with this handset, here are our unbiased thoughts on the Samsung Galaxy M40, a handset that comes with several series firsts such as a Qualcomm Snapdragon SoC, a punch-hole display and the well-received One UI.  Design, Build  The Samsung Galaxy M40 bucks the trend that had been set with previous M-Series handsets and instead of looking like a budget model, this handset comes with a restrained class that very few smartphone manufacturers can replicate. Available in two variants of Blue \u2014 Midnight Blue and Seawater Blue, both variants have their own charm that can appeal to a wide audience. In a time where smartphones are fitted with various layers that produce gradient shades depending on how the light touches it, the Samsung Galaxy M40 is finished in an unapologetic monotone rear that oozes appeal. While there are no gradient finishes here, it does have a beautifully curved glossy back panel that looks as classy as some of the handsets that are above the Rs 50K price mark.  Being a midrange device, there are some compromises. Instead of a glass back, Samsung has fitted a polycarbonate shell that has a glass-like finish. It will be really hard pressed to tell the difference from afar and Samsung has done well with the overall design of the M40. The chassis comes with the same finish as the rear and its curved sides make for comfortable handling. Having a glossy finish, the M40 is susceptible to a high amount of fingerprint residue thereby causing the handset to look a bit shabby. The argument always persists \u2014 should you use a handset with or without a case? In this case, merely for its aesthetic appeal, we would recommend using a case that not only shows off the design but also prevents smudges. There is a drawback to adding a case as well. By adding a rear protector, you may tend to bulk up the overall width of the M40. Also, being a fairly slim and lightweight handset, you also tend to lose out on the overall handling as Samsung intended. If this isn't an issue and you have no problem compromising the handling experience for the sake of the design then go ahead and use a case.  The triple camera's bump isn't that large as some of the other handsets seen in the market, but it isn't as flush as some of its Chinese counterparts. The LED flash is located below the vertically aligned rear cameras; giving it a very modern look. The rear also plays home to an oblong fingerprint sensor and setting up your fingerprint is pretty unique. Instead of repeatedly tapping the sensor, all one is required to do is swipe the desired finger on the sensor to register it. This is one of the fastest fingerprint setups we have ever done.  A feature we didn't appreciate here was the lack of a headphone jack. While it's true Samsung has done all it can to shrink the M40 as much as it can, losing out on this port is a serious miss. We understand the entire world is going wireless but having that option is always a nice gesture. As a remedy, Samsung has included a pair of really great sounding Type-C earphones as a part of the packaging. The other prominent design inclusions here are the use of a USB Type-C port, easily accessible buttons, and a hybrid SIM tray.  Overall, the design of the M40 stands tall in a crowd dominated by flashy devices.  Display  The handset is fitted with a gorgeous 6.3-inch PLS LCD display which happens to be Samsung's proprietary technology so you can be rest assured that the brand has fine-tuned it to produce the best possible results without any compromises. Coming to the main headlining feature of the Samsung Galaxy M40, the handset is fitted with an Infinity-O display. If you recall, this is a similar display that's used on Samsung's flagship smartphone, the Galaxy S10 and it's rumoured to make its way on to the Galaxy Note 10 as well. Having a punch-hole display on a smartphone priced under Rs 20K is no small feat and it shows Samsung's commitment to this midrange segment by aggressively adding features that are common in smartphones above the Rs 30,000 mark. With that being said, Samsung hasn't used an OLED panel here but rather an LCD display which hardly takes away any of the shine of the Galaxy M40.  The M40 features slim bezels on three sides and a slight chin; which doesn't take away any of the smartphone's appeal. If you actually stop to analyse the price of the handset with this punch-hole LCD display, Samsung has done seriously well to keep its sides down to a minimum. The LCD display is one of the most responsive we have seen and swiping through the content here is an absolute breeze. In fact, we were pleasantly surprised to see how fluid it actually is.  The Samsung Galaxy M40 comes with a high-quality display that's not just bright but also vibrant. This display reminds us of Samsung flagships of old that used to come with the rich, vibrant colours that made them instant fan favourites. Colours here are vivid and crisp even completely viewable in direct sunlight due to the nearly 500 nits brightness. Viewing angles are great as well which makes this device great for media consumption.  Overall, we give this display a strong 5 out of 5 as we rarely see a flagship-grade display on a smartphone priced this competitively.  Software  The Samsung Galaxy M40 comes with Samsung's One UI 1.1, the same OS that's found on the brand's flagship Galaxy S10 devices. For years, Samsung had been limited by its clunky and rather overbearing UI and with this latest operating system, the brand gives you a software that's not just extremely light but has a lot of similarities to a stock Android handset.  In comparison to the Galaxy S10, the features on this One UI handset are a bit slim; however, it is packed with enough features that offer an intuitive experience. With this skin, you get all the goodness of Android 9 Pie, the software which this handset is based on such as gesture navigation, double tap to wake, Digital Wellbeing, one-handed mode and a lot more. The only feature we found lacking here was the full version of Samsung Galaxy Pay that's in-built on the Galaxy A70, one of the trendiest smartphones available this month. Interestingly, the handset also comes with a dedicated Dark Mode here but the true blacks here are missing due to the lack of an OLED display. However, it's pretty great that Samsung added it in nonetheless and way ahead of Android Q, where the feature will appear by default.  With this handset, Samsung aims to give you the best experience even when it comes to content consumption as this handset comes with Widevine L1. With this feature in tow, you can watch HD content on popular video streaming platforms such as Netflix and Amazon Prime. The sound her on the M40 is also taken care off by Dolby Atmos which gives you an all-around media experience.  Lastly, the handset should be upgradable to at least two major Android updates which are namely Android Q and Android R. So, in other words, this device is pretty future-proof; at least where software updates are concerned.  Performance  The Samsung Galaxy M40 is fitted with a Snapdragon 675 SoC and paired with 6GB of LPDDR4 RAM along with a massive 128GB of onboard storage. In the performance department, the Galaxy M40 truly excels causing us no problems whatsoever. For those who are interested in comparing smartphones based on its specifications, this is the same processor that fitted on a host of other handsets such as the costlier Galaxy A70, the Redmi Note 7 Pro, the vivo V15 Pro, the Meizu Note 9 and other smartphones that have fared extremely well this year.  This is a performance-oriented octa-core midrange processor and it comes with two performance-based Kyro 460 cores clocked at 2.0GHz and six Kyro 460 cores that are clocked at 1.7GHz. With these in play, you can be assured of 15 per cent faster app launches, and up to a massive 35 per cent improvement in web browsing speeds. Another major plus point with this processor is that it supports triple camera configurations, which is another highlighted feature of the Galaxy M40. This chipset comes with an enhanced version of the Spectra 250 ISP that allows it to easily take care of three camera sensors simultaneously. In fact, this chipset is so good that it is on par with the Snapdragon 710, a processor that belongs to a higher category.  When it comes to raw performance, the Galaxy M40 excels in everything that's thrown at it; be it multitasking or pulling up apps from the background. Gaming on this device is an absolute pleasure and even with the settings turned up to maximum, it still performs without any lag or stutter. Although the device performed as advertised, we did notice some slight thermal issues when playing graphic intensive games at high settings. For the best possible experience, we suggest using medium settings for graphic heavy games.  Camera  The cameras on the Galaxy M40 are the other major talking point of this speedy handset. Fitted with a triple rear camera setup on the rear, the M40 boasts a 32MP primary sensor, a 5MP depth sensor and an 8MP ultra-wide angle lens. Combining these three sensors, you get pretty incredible shots and much better than some handsets that cost Rs 5,000 more. Samsung has done well to add this camera setup in the M40, as it is the same one that's used on the Galaxy A70, a smartphone that fared extremely well in our review.  To break it down, the 32MP primary sensor comes with an F\/1.7 aperture that's wide enough to take in a lot of light which can help in low-light shots, the 8MP sensor comes with 123-degree field of view which is pretty impressive for a smartphone priced below Rs 20K and an F\/2.2 5MP depth sensor that's used for Samsung's Live Focus mode which is the brand's terminology for Portrait mode. Up front, there is a 16MP sensor that comes with an F\/2.0 aperture that's a solid performer as well.  On paper, the Galaxy M40 has very capable sensors and thankfully, this actually does translate into its performances. The rear sensors capture images well in varied lighting conditions with colours appearing natural with a fair amount of detail noticed as well. Like all handsets in and around its price range, there are a few drawbacks here and these are especially noticeable in indoor or low light shots. In well-lit environments, the M40 faces no such obstacles with images having the right amount of saturation and the perfect amount of punch that makes photos look appealing for not just social media but also as keepsakes. The Live Focus mode on the M40 stands head over shoulders above any other smartphone in this price range as its edge-detection is near perfect. Samsung's neat trick of adjusting the type of blur is another feature that can be a hit with users as you just don't only get the standard blur, but various effects as well.  Battery  The battery is probably the only disappointing feature of the Galaxy M40. When brands are adding 4000mAh batteries on their handset in order to give nearly two days of battery life, Samsung has added a mere 3500mAh battery here. While using this handset as our primary device during the review period, at the end of the workday, with heavy usage the battery was completely dead. Luckily, there is fast charging support of 15W which tops up the battery fairly quickly.  Verdict  The Samsung Galaxy M40 comes in a single configuration and is priced at Rs 19,990. For this price, you get a smartphone that comes with the coveted Infinity-O display at a price that pales in comparison to its rivals, a speedy chipset that's found in handsets that cost a lot more and great snappers all around that give rivals a run for their money. While there may be other brands that offer similar specifications, they fail to match the assurances a Samsung can provide. If you plan on purchasing this device, you get transparency that only the South Korean tech giant can back and the peace of mind that only they can offer. If you do buy this handset, which we definitely recommend, you also are offered brand value and bragging rights and that will be the envy of many as you not just get the performance that the handset offers but value for every single rupee you spend.","tags":"smartphone|TAG|mobiles & tabs|TAG|technology|TAG|samsung galaxy m40|TAG|review","category":"Technology","primary_image_url":"https:\/\/s3.ap-southeast-1.amazonaws.com\/images.asianage.com\/images\/aa-Cover-l8uufh59rr68jaaqhgvht9ld34-20190622114357.jpeg","primary_image_width":400,"primary_image_height":224,"secondary_image_url":null,"secondary_image_width":0,"secondary_image_height":0,"publisher":"Unavailable","publisher_domain":"Unavailable"}

The survey includes responses from 660 executives, individual contributors and team managers serving in IT-security roles. (Photo: ANI)  Barracuda today released key findings from a report with the title 2019 Email Security Trends. Commissioned by Barracuda, the research surveyed global IT stakeholders to capture their experiences and attitudes about the current state of email security.  The survey includes responses from 660 executives, individual contributors and team managers serving in IT-security roles in the Americas, EMEA, and APAC. Companies surveyed include small, mid-sized, and enterprise businesses in technology, financial services, education, healthcare, manufacturing, government, telecommunication, retail, and other industries. A wide range of questions captured hard data about phishing, insider threats and Office 365, as well as the related business impacts, security spending and costs of breaches.  Overall, the study indicates that while most IT professionals are more confident about their email security systems than they were a year ago, email attacks continue to have a significant impact on businesses. Highlights include:  1. Email attacks are having a direct business impact\u2014 and impacting the personal lives of IT security professionals. 74% of respondents said that email attacks are having a major impact on their businesses.  The most common effects cited were loss of employee productivity, downtime and business disruption, and damage to the reputation of the IT team. Nearly three-quarters of respondents reported experiencing higher stress levels, worrying about potential email security even when they're not at work, and being forced to work nights and weekends to address email security issues.  2. Phishing and ransomware are top concerns.  43% of organizations have been the victim of a spear-phishing attack in the past 12 months.  3. Breach costs and monetary losses are on the rise.  78% of organizations said that the cost of email breaches is increasing. 66% claimed that attacks have had a direct monetary cost on their organization in the past year. Nearly a quarter of respondents advised that attacks have cost their organization $100,000 or more.  4. Employees remain a major weak link in an organization's security defenses.  More than three-quarters of organizations said their employees aren't good at spotting suspicious emails.  5. There are growing concerns about insider threats and Office 365.  79% of IT professionals said they are worried about attacks and breaches stemming from inside the organization. 92% of Office 365 users have security concerns.  Based on the success and proliferation of email-based attacks, IT security professionals will need to stay focused on the evolution and escalation of phishing, ransomware, and other threats and improve email security that goes beyond the traditional gateway. Barracuda offers a broad solution against email-borne targeted attacks and social engineering.","tags":"technology|TAG|in other news|TAG|cyber security|TAG|email","category":"Technology","primary_image_url":"https:\/\/s3.ap-southeast-1.amazonaws.com\/images.asianage.com\/images\/aa-Cover-bg8q83tb1u0eu5mgn0uectin71-20190407122817.jpeg","primary_image_width":400,"primary_image_height":224,"secondary_image_url":null,"secondary_image_width":0,"secondary_image_height":0,"publisher":"Unavailable","publisher_domain":"Unavailable"}

The results helped Alphabet dismiss as a rare blip a USD 1 billion revenue miss in the first quarter.  Alphabet Inc shares rose about 8 per cent after the company reported quarterly results that eased investors' concerns about growth challenges facing its Google advertising business.  Driven by ad sales, second-quarter revenue and earnings beat analysts' expectations. In addition, the world's largest online search and ads firm, unlike No. 2 online ad player Facebook Inc a day earlier, offered no worrisome guidance about increasing regulatory scrutiny.  The results helped Alphabet dismiss as a rare blip a USD 1 billion revenue miss in the first quarter, which had prompted an outburst of investor questions and the biggest one-day sell-off in its shares in about seven years.  In after-hours trade on Thursday, the shares rose to USD 1,226.60, on track for their biggest single-day increase in four years though still down about 4 per cent from their high before the April slide.  Alphabet's shares have lagged peers on Wall Street this year, rising about 9 percent through Thursday's close, compared to a roughly 20 per cent gain for the S&P 500 broadly.  Questions linger about whether privacy, content moderation and antitrust rules proposed or already passed in the United States and other high-revenue countries will slash ad prices. Google also faces an industrywide slowdown in ad sales in the United States and Europe, with revenue from emerging markets not yet picking up the slack.  Google Chief Executive Sundar Pichai told analysts on Thursday that advances in ad targeting and new services for consumers worldwide would spur growth. He said the company had survived calls for regulation before.  \u201cWe understand there will be scrutiny,\u201d and \u201cwe will engage constructively,\u201d he said.  Weakening Concerns  Alphabet, which generates about 85 percent of its revenue from sales of ad space and ad technology, reported total second-quarter revenue of USD 38.9 billion. That was up 19 per cent over last year and compared with 17 per cent growth in the first quarter. Analysts on average estimated 16.8 per cent growth and USD 38.2 billion in revenue, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.  The last time that Alphabet had two consecutive quarters of revenue growth below 20 per cent was three years ago.  Executives said the latest results backed their contention that the performance recently has been affected by currency exchange rates and one-off fluctuations rather than advertiser flight or some deeper challenge to its business.  Alphabet's chief financial officer, Ruth Porat, appeared to dispel other analyst concerns, saying the company has seen \u201cvirtually no impact\u201d to revenue from efforts to stop running ads on YouTube videos that some have characterized as extremist or hateful.  Alphabet authorized up to USD 25 billion in new stock buybacks, aiming to make use of its USD 121 billion in cash.  Pichai said quarterly revenue from licensing cloud computing services and workplace software jumped to about USD 2 billion, from its last disclosure of USD 1 billion at the end of 2017. He said the cloud unit would triple its sales staff over the next few years.  Atlantic Equities analyst James Cordwell told Reuters in an email that the buyback and cloud updates \u201csuggests that management cares about stock performance, which will be a relief to shareholders!\u201d  Net income for the second quarter rose to USD 9.95 billion, or USD 14.21 per share, compared with analysts' estimates of USD 8.02 billion, or USD 11.32 per share.  Alphabet's quarterly costs at USD 29.76 billion were about flat with the same period a year ago. The operating margin was 24 per cent, up from 18 per cent in the first quarter.  Alphabet in its earnings release on Thursday did not mention any government investigations.  Facebook Inc, along with the release of its earnings on Wednesday, said the FTC had informed it last month that it was under antitrust investigation. The social media giant also acknowledged a broad US Department of Justice antitrust review of large internet companies.  Reuters reported last month that the US Federal Trade Commission was gearing up to investigate Google over complaints of anti-competitive behaviour.  Accusations lodged against Google by rivals and other critics span its advertising, app store, search and other businesses.  On Thursday, the Texas attorney general's office announced that a bipartisan group of state attorneys general is weighing a range of antitrust actions against big tech companies.","tags":"technology|TAG|alphabet|TAG|in other news","category":"Technology","primary_image_url":"https:\/\/s3.ap-southeast-1.amazonaws.com\/images.asianage.com\/images\/aa-Cover-ilbrrabfksagbfb0ompgpgran2-20180424093701.jpeg","primary_image_width":400,"primary_image_height":224,"secondary_image_url":null,"secondary_image_width":0,"secondary_image_height":0,"publisher":"Unavailable","publisher_domain":"Unavailable"}

Amidst nearly every smartphone brand going to lengths to get rid of the notches they showed off proudly not many months ago, Huawei has surprisingly decided to keep the notch for their upcoming smartphone, the Mate 30 Pro.  And it's not even the water-drop notch, it's the wide one!

More leaks suggest that the Huawei Mate 30 will also feature the large screen and wide notch. The Mate 30 Pro is believed to have extremely curved edges like the ones on the Oneplus 7 Pro.  The Mate 30 will meanwhile sport moderate curves on the side edges. The side and bottom bezels for both the remain extremely thin.  Huawei has not however revealed any dates for the launch of the devices which is probably due to the ongoing US tensions that the brand is tackling.","tags":"mobiles & tabs|TAG|huawei mate 30|TAG|technology|TAG|huawei mate 30 pro|TAG|huawei","category":"Technology","primary_image_url":"https:\/\/s3.ap-southeast-1.amazonaws.com\/images.asianage.com\/images\/aa-Cover-tb6kspf4gfd5bg8l1ai8kaesq7-20190726172426.jpeg","primary_image_width":400,"primary_image_height":224,"secondary_image_url":null,"secondary_image_width":0,"secondary_image_height":0,"publisher":"Unavailable","publisher_domain":"Unavailable"}

Just 2% of the 243,000 videos uploaded that week featured at least one individual that looked under 13 years old to human reviewers. But the small subset received an average of 298,000 views.  YouTube videos featuring young children drew nearly triple the average viewership of the platform's other content, according to research released on Thursday that provided ammunition for child advocates who want Alphabet Inc to take more aggressive steps to make its streaming service safer for kids.  Pew Research Center said its findings show videos aimed at or featuring children are among YouTube's most popular materials, attracting an outsized audience relative to the number uploaded.  YouTube has come under fire in recent years from lawmakers and parent groups who contend it has not done enough to protect the privacy of minors.  Last year, the Center for Digital Democracy and the Campaign for a Commercial-Free Childhood (CCFC) filed a complaint with the Federal Trade Commission (FTC), saying YouTube's parent company violated the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act.  The complaint said the company \u201cmade a vast amount of money by using children's personal information\u201d and \u201cprofited from advertising revenues from ads on its YouTube channels that are watched by children.\u201d  \u201cYouTube likes to pretend its not a site for children until it's time to sell ads,\u201d CCFC Executive Director Josh Golin said.  \u201cWe have always been clear YouTube has never been for people under 13,\u201d said YouTube, which announced 2 billion monthly users in May. The platform shares limited data, but music, gaming and kids' content are known to rank highly in viewership.  Other groups have called for more steps to block access to age-inappropriate content and to deter potential predators. Complaints prompted YouTube to introduce punishments for parents uploading videos showing kids placed in dangerous situations. The platform has said it is weighing additional changes.  Pew researchers said they analyzed activity during the first week of 2019 on nearly 44,000 YouTube channels with more than 250,000 subscribers.  Just 2% of the 243,000 videos uploaded that week featured at least one individual that looked under 13 years old to human reviewers. But the small subset received an average of 298,000 views, compared with 97,000 for videos without children, according to the report. Median viewership figures were about 57,000 and 14,000.  Channels that uploaded at least one video featuring a child averaged 1.8 million subscribers, compared to 1.2 million for those that did not, Pew said.  YouTube said it could not comment on Pew's survey methods or results. It maintained that the most popular categories are comedy, music, sports and \u201chow to\u201d videos.  Popular videos with children included those with parenting tips or children singing or dressing up.  YouTube's policies ban children under 13 from using its main service and instead direct them to its curated YouTube Kids app. But many parents use the main YouTube service to entertain or educate children, other research has found.","tags":"technology|TAG|in other news|TAG|youtubers|TAG|youtube","category":"Technology","primary_image_url":"https:\/\/s3.ap-southeast-1.amazonaws.com\/images.asianage.com\/images\/aa-Cover-hf2pkt57m5017dddaumobms7b5-20181201234420.jpeg","primary_image_width":400,"primary_image_height":224,"secondary_image_url":null,"secondary_image_width":0,"secondary_image_height":0,"publisher":"Unavailable","publisher_domain":"Unavailable"}

When Xiaomi announced the Redmi K20 as the new flagship killer, everyone's eyes were turned to the upcoming device. Now after its launch, The K20 does deliver most features from the Oneplus 7 Pro like the pop-up front camera, the massive battery and the seventh generation in-display fingerprint reader.  While we are not just yet comparing the quality of the similar features offered on both devices, if one thing sets the Oneplus 7 Pro apart from pretty much most other flagships, including its younger brother, the Oneplus 7, it is the gorgeous display with a 90Hz refresh rate.  However, the superhuman developers over at XDA have devised a sneaky method of getting the high refresh rate screen on the budget-friendly Redmi K20 series too. A mod allows the standard screen refresh rate of the K20 series phones to be bumped up to 75Hz.  This isn't the first time XDA developers beat the stock refresh rate on a Xiaomi device. We've seen mods that let the MI 9 run at up to a 84Hz refresh rate.  While the current K20 mod supports a 75Hz refresh rate, the developers believe that the device is even capable of refreshing at 90Hz, which is the same as the Oneplus 7 Pro, a device that costs over twice as much as the base Redmi K20. However the Oneplus 7 Pro screen is optimized to run at 90Hz, compared to the Redmi K20, which could lose battery pretty quick on the higher refresh rate.  Do note that the mod requires an unlocked bootloader and a custom recovery. Developers ask users to use the mod at their own risk (it could physically damage your K20 screen) and this mod is not for people who aren't accustomed to the terms 'bootloader' and 'custom recovery'. Proceed only if you want to live on the absolute bleeding edge with your Redmi K20\/K20 Pro.

Rating:  In the realm of mobile accessories, Baseus is a brand that needs no introduction. Over the last few years, the brand has launched products that appeal to a wide audience and its mantra of keeping the price as low as possible yet offering the best features is what makes it achieve its mass fan following. The brand has one of the biggest smartphone accessory stores on AliExpress and you can purchase products ranging from smartphone cases to power banks and car chargers to styluses.  Building on its extensive portfolio, Baseus has recently introduced the Encok S17 Bluetooth earphones and I am quite impressed with it. These babies fit my needs as a workout enthusiast as well as my hunger for great sounding earphones to compliment my workout. After using it extensively for the past few days, here are my thoughts on it.  Design  When it comes to earphones, there are a couple of things I focus on \u2014 they have to sound good and they have to look great. For me, earphones are an extension of myself and they have to fit in the lifestyle I lead. The Baseus Encok S17 is a pair of earphones that check both the boxes leaving me truly satisfied. Being a frequent gym goer, I need earphones that remain locked-in no matter how strenuous the workout is. Featuring soft gel silicone ear hooks, the S17 sits securely in the ear without budging thereby giving me all the assurances I need to continue focusing on my workout.  The Encok S17 is designed for those who have an active lifestyle and have added an angled design that sits comfortably in the ear canal. These earphones borrow its overall design from some of the bigger brands out there but have traits that make it unique enough to stand out in a crowd. A feature I absolutely loved here was the lightweight design at just 22g. This allowed me to wear it and even forget that I have it on. In the process, I never felt any fatigue while using it.  These earphones are priced at Rs 1,999 here in India and hence it doesn't come with a Type-C port for charging. It uses the conventional micro-USB charging option as this is a more convenient solution. Micro-USB cables are easily accessible which allows you to charge it pretty much everywhere. At an airport, I had no issue topping up the 100mAh dual battery and in just an hour and a half, I was able to get close to 7-hours of audio playback; which is pretty impressive. It is also worth noting that you get up to 200 hours of standby time on the S17.  Baseus highlights the magnetic lock on the Encok S17 and this helps keep it secure around your neck when not in use. Unlike the OnePLus Bullets Wireless earphones, the magnets are simply added to keep them locked in place and feature no additional functionality. I would have preferred if they also offered the option to play\/pause the earphones when locked in as it would alleviate them to a whole new status. But at this price, there are not many complaints from us.  The in-line remote control has all the necessary functions and the buttons here are quite tactile. This unit is made of plastic and feels quite durable enough to survive a bit of rough usage. The only issue I had with it was the power button not registering when I tried to turn it off. I always had to long-press it multiple times before I received the in-ear notification that it was powering down.  Performance  The Baseus Encok S17 is fitted with 12mm moving coil speakers that offer clear sound at all times. Combine this with Bluetooth v5.0, you get a stable connection even with your smartphone or tablet located at even a far-off distance. Also, by using this Bluetooth standard, the power consumption is also reduced and you effectively get a better audio transmission.  Due to the design of the in-ear monitors, you also get a fair amount of passive noise isolation allowing you to tune in, zone out and get lost in your music. With that being said, during calls, I could hear the person on the other end clearly. However, the person on the other end complained that my voice sometimes sounded a bit muffled. There could be various reasons for my voice being incomprehensible and not necessarily the fault of the earphones.  A feature I loved here was the IPX5 certification. While bigger brands are skirting this feature in order to keep the price down, it's great that Baseus has included it and in the process giving us the assurance that the Encok S17 won't get ruined after a few sweaty sessions in the gym. However, it is best to avoid these earphones in the rain as there is a chance it may not fare as well.  The Encok S17 features independent sound chambers which contain 12mm PU composite diaphragm which helps in producing high-resolution sound along with powerful bass output. Apart from this, Baseus claims that these earphones are tuned by acoustic experts so that the frequencies produced by the S17 achieve a balance and offer a richer, dynamic audio quality. I felt this to be true to an extent as the bass output was decent and much better than I expected. The highs are quite reaching and mids aren't really glossed over by the other frequencies. While saying I got a rich sound is exaggerating it; I did receive an audio quality that will be satisfactory to most casual listeners and workout enthusiasts. And I can overemphasize this point due to the punchy bass that's on offer.  Verdict  The Baseus Encok S17 is available for USD 25.95 at Amazon.com and Rs 1,999 on Amazon.in. With these earphones, Baseus offers you so much more than what you pay for. Rarely do you find earphones that are so light and extremely comfortable at the same time in this price range making it an ideal option not just for the gym-goers but for anyone in general. They also look pretty great and offer quite an amazing audio experience. Being sweat-resistant and having the magnetic locks also aides in its cause. With the S17, it is great to see that there are brands out there who offer great products without forcing you to burn a hole in your pocket. To sum it up, If you are looking for a pair of sporty earphones that look plenty good, these are an option worth considering.","tags":"technology|TAG|earphones|TAG|baseus encok s17|TAG|gadgets|TAG|review","category":"Technology","primary_image_url":"https:\/\/s3.ap-southeast-1.amazonaws.com\/images.asianage.com\/images\/aa-Cover-c7e3rgrom86vmgs2mv60g9eht5-20190616105047.jpeg","primary_image_width":400,"primary_image_height":224,"secondary_image_url":null,"secondary_image_width":0,"secondary_image_height":0,"publisher":"Unavailable","publisher_domain":"Unavailable"}

Intel reported second-quarter revenue of USD 16.5 billion and adjusted earnings of USD 1.06 per share. (Photo: AFP)  Intel Corp (INTC.O) forecast current-quarter profit and revenue above estimates and raised its full-year revenue forecast on Thursday, allaying concerns about a global semiconductor sales slowdown and curbs on US sales to China's Huawei Technologies Co Ltd [HWT.UL].  Intel shares rose 4.9 per cent to USD 54.70 in extended trading.  The chip industry is in a slowdown, with research firm Gartner forecasting a 9.6 per cent drop in global semiconductor revenue in 2019, to USD 429 billion. US-China trade tensions, including tariffs on some products and the restrictions on sales to Huawei, are pressuring chipmakers.  But those factors did not trouble Intel, which was the second chipmaker this week to beat analysts' earnings estimates. On Tuesday, Texas Instruments Inc (TXN.O) said US-China trade tensions were not hampering its ability to conduct business in China.  Intel's chief financial officer, George Davis, told Reuters the company had resumed some product sales to Huawei that comply with US regulations. Tariff threats between the United States and China actually helped second-quarter sales by about USD 400 million, Intel executives said.  \u201cCustomers concerned about supply risk in the second half of the year related to those items pulled in some demand into the second quarter,\u201d Davis said in an interview. \u201cIt isn't a net add to the full year (forecast), but it certainly de-risks some of the full year.\u201d  Intel reported second-quarter revenue of USD 16.5 billion and adjusted earnings of USD 1.06 per share. Analysts on average had expected revenue of USD 15.7 billion and adjusted earnings of 89 cents per share, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.  But it was the company's forecast that drove up shares, with third-quarter revenue and profit forecast to be USD 18 billion and USD 1.24 per share, above analysts' estimate of USD 17.72 billion and USD 1.16 per share.  The company estimated 2019 revenue of USD 69.5 billion, instead of the USD 69 billion it told investors to expect in April. Chief Executive Bob Swan told investors on a conference call that Intel has two factories now producing 10-nanometer chips - the next generation of manufacturing technology which Intel has struggled to bring online - and said plans to produce 7-nanometer chips by 2021 remain on track.  \u201cWe're most impressed by progress on 10-nanometer ramp,\u201d Abhinav Davuluri, an equity analyst with Morningstar, said.  Intel also said it planned to sell the majority of its modem business to Apple Inc (AAPL.O) for USD 1 billion. About 2,200 Intel employees will join Apple, which will acquire a trove of patents under the deal.  Davis told Reuters the payment was all cash. Intel will retain the rights to make non-smartphone modems for self-driving cars and PCs under the deal.  The company estimated a USD 500 million after-tax gain from the sale of the modem business.  After years of acquisitions outside its core area of processing chips under previous leaders, Swan has set a goal of becoming more disciplined about spending, slowing investments in areas like memory chips and shedding struggling businesses.  Dan Ives of Wedbush Securities said the sales were a step in the right direction.  \u201cWe believe further divestitures of non-core businesses would certainly make (Intel) look more attractive, while allowing management to more closely focus on improving core operations increasing the likelihood of future execution, but we are not yet convinced management will move in this direction,\u201d he said in a note.

Rating:  When it comes to smartphone technology married with precise design implementation, few brands can compare with Huawei and its offshoot brand Honor. Over the past few years, Honor has grown in leaps and bound and it has rapidly developed recognition for launching brilliant flagship smartphones at prices that rivals can't touch.  The Honor 20 series is a testament to Honor's understanding of the smartphone market and have launched not one but three flagships at varied price points that target a wide array of consumers. The Honor 20 Pro as the name suggests is the top-end model of the trio while the Honor 20i comes in with the most budget-friendly price tag. Sitting well placed in the middle of the bunch is the Honor 20 it comes with nearly identical features as the top of the line Honor 20 Pro; thereby giving it its flagship status but targeted at those who don't want to shell out those few thousands for something as minuscule as a telephoto camera and a slight bump in battery capacity.  Having used the Honor 20 as our primary handset for the span of a few weeks, here are our thoughts on one of the best affordable flagships that have been launched in the first half of 2019.  Design, Build  Huawei and its offshoot brand Honor have built up a healthy reputation of launching smartphones that not only come with the best of specifications but also feature a design that not many can rival. Like Honor handsets of the recent past, the Honor 20 comes with a jaw-dropping and stunning design. This in itself makes us recommend the handset to those who are merely looking for a beautiful handset to show-off and the Honor 20 delivers it in spades.  The Honor 20 and 20 Pro look nearly identical and it's quite difficult telling the difference between the two. This design thinking was intentional on Honor's part as they wanted the slightly lower-end model to be as much of a flagship handset as the Honor 20 Pro. With this newly launched series of handsets, Honor has done what it does best and launched a handset with an industrial design that few can match up to.  Built with an iconic glass back, the Honor 20's rear comes with a mirrored finish that creates subtle patterns and highlights that shine and move alongside its varied lengths. It is no easy feat to create this design and the brand's R&D team has worked tirelessly to achieve this 'Dynamic Holographic' design. Featuring a triple 3D mesh design, the rear plays home to three layers \u2014 a glass panel, a colour panel and a depth layer. By combining these three layers Honor is able to achieve a rear design that's immersive yet having a wonderfully glossy finish. In most cases, we would baulk at handsets with a glossy back, but as is the case with the Honor 20, you get a depth effect that goes beyond being just surface level. Honor has stated that producing this rear panel is no small feat and most that were manufactured didn't make it to the Honor 20 series and only a few were carefully selected.  The 3D mesh design on the rear panel isn't the only highlight of the smartphone's design. The Honor 20 also comes with curved sides; with the curvature being a lot more than found on another handset. This curved panel was done in order to make the handset easy to handle so it sits comfortably in the palm. Compared to rival smartphones, the weight of the Honor 20 is kept down to a minimum; this makes it all the more appealing. The brand not only managed to pack four cameras at the back, a pretty sizable 3750mAh battery but also a 6.26-inch screen here and still keep its weight down to a mere 182g.  The Honor 20's rounded sides come bearing the brand's industrial design and the only feature that stands out, or rather in, as is the case here is the power button that housed in a recessed groove on the side. This feature isn't added for just aesthetic purposes as it also doubles up as the fingerprint sensor. While the fingerprint scanner is one of the fastest we have ever witness, it also doesn't benefit those who are lefties as it's more comfortable for those who are right-handed. We guess this a small oversight on the part of Honor and we don't see them losing many brownie points over this design decision. With that being said, for those who are right-handed can benefit greatly from its positioning as it is easy to reach.  Being a 2019 handset and a flagship at that, the Honor 20 comes with a USB Type-C charging port with fast charging support. Next, to the charging slot you get the speaker grille and the microphone. A cute addition to the Honor 20 is the inclusion of a notification LED that's located behind the earpiece. Even though Honor eliminated the notch for a punch-hole display, they made sure that you don't miss out on your notifications when the screen's off. We really appreciate Honor for retaining the notification LED despite providing you with a nearly bezel-less display.  Overall, the Honor 20 is a pretty handset that's definitely recommended. Coupled with its design and lightweight form factor, we see this handset becoming an instant favourite for many of you out there.  Display  The honor was one of the first in the world to introduce the punch-hole style displays that were later found on the Samsung Galaxy S10 series of handsets. The Honor 20, being a part of the brand's N Series also comes equipped with this minimalistic display. While Samsung's punch-hole camera cutout is fairly large, Honor's take on it is pretty small giving it an all-screen look.  As mentioned earlier, the Honor 20 is identical to the Honor 20 Pro and this even includes the size of the display. The handset comes with a 6.26-inch IPS FHD+ LCD display that sports a resolution of 1080 x 2340 pixels. Featuring a punch-hole display that measures just 4.5mm in diameter, the Honor 20 comes with an 84.2 per cent screen to body ratio with a 19:5:9 aspect ratio.  The display on the Honor 20 is really good and there are absolutely no faults with it. Colours here have a slight bit of over saturation and this isn't a bad thing as it makes the content onscreen appear more vibrant and lively. Playing games and watching videos are pretty great here and so are the viewing angles. While using the handset indoors, you get a beautiful bright display that represents everything onscreen to perfection. In direct sunlight, content onscreen is a bit difficult to decipher as the handset uses an LCD panel. This is a small issue and nothing to really worry yourself over.  With that being said, flagship smartphones nowadays all come with OLED panels and because of it, you get deep blacks, an always-on display and various other battery saving features. The Honor 20, unfortunately, doesn't have this panel onboard so there are the above-mentioned compromises you have to make. However, die to Honor using an LCD panel, the brand has managed to keep its price down to a minimum.  Software  The Honor 20 series runs on the Magic UI 2.1 which is based on Android 9 Pie and while it's not as clean as a stock Android UI that's seen on an Android One handset; it is pretty well optimized as well. This version of Magic UI gets the GPU Turbo 3.0 which is by far the biggest takeaway here as it helps in smoothening out the overall performance and helps with power efficiency in the games that are supported.  With Magic UI, Honor has added a ton of customization options that make the handset unique to you much as Huawei has done with its EMUI OS. Having used the handset for a fairly long time, we have noticed that the handset faced no issues related to the software. To get the best out of your handset, all the customizations should be done from the moment it's unboxed. This helps with the overall feel of the device.  Overall, the software used here is fairly intuitive and people who are migrating from a different brand will get used to it within a matter of days. Lastly, as is the case with most Android smartphones, there is a bit of bloatware, some of which can be uninstalled to free space for apps you actually need.  Performance  The Honor 20 sits below the Honor 20 Pro in the pecking order; but make no mistake, this handset is filled to the brim with raw power making it one of the speediest handset available in the market so far. Under the hood, you get a top-of-the-line HiSilicon Kirin 980 SoC, the same one that's found on the Huawei Mate 20 Pro and P30 Pro flagships. It may not be quite a trailblazer as the Qualcomm Snapdragon 855 chipset, but it's not that far off either.  The real world performance of the Honor 20 is a wonderful thing and there is absolutely no lag noticeable anywhere across the board. High-end games like Asphalt 9, PUBG Mobile and even Fortnite ran flawlessly with no stutter or framing issues. This handset is targeted at the youth and we can see consumers spending hours clocking in a win after win because of the speedy performances that the handset has to offer. A clear advantage the Honor 20 has over its rivals is the fact that it features a punch-hole display and you get beautiful all-screen gaming experience. This is where the punch-hole trumps the notch. While gaming, this cut out is barely noticeable and after a few seconds of intense gameplay, you will forget that it is even there.  The handset we received for review is the 6GB\/128GB variant and it was quite sufficient for most tasks. Multitasking and pulling apps from the background was a cinch and it rivals any other flagship available in the market today.  Apart from this, there is also a dedicated Performance Mode which as the name suggests helps you get the maximum performance out of the Honor 20. While this is great in theory and we see it being useful in certain circumstances, we need to mention that it doesn't bode well for battery life.  To sum up this section of the review, the Honor 20 is a beast that's wrapped in beauty's clothes making it an ideal choice for virtually anyone.  Camera  Honor doesn't tout this handset as the 'Camera King' for nothing. Just as the performance of the handset shattered all expectations, the camera quality found here is unrivalled by anything in its price range. The Honor 20 comes packing four rear cameras. Yes, you read that right! There is a quad camera setup on the back and this helps it in achieving its royalty title.  The Honor 20 comes with a 48MP IMX586 primary sensor with an F\/1.8 aperture along with OIS, EIS and AIS. There is an ultra-wide angle 16MP sensor with an F\/2.2 aperture and 117-degree field of view, a dedicated 2MP macro camera and 2MP depth sensor. This is one of the two areas where the Honor 20 is lacking in comparison to the Honor 20 Pro. The premium model of the two gets a 48MP primary camera and a world's first F\/1.4 aperture which helps in taking a lot more light and helps greatly in low-light photography. The ultra-wide angle sensor is the same here but the Honor 20 Pro gets an 8MP sensor with an F\/2.4 aperture that's capable of 3x lossless optical zoom with stabilisation features. There is a dedicated macro lens on the 20 Pro that features a 2MP sensor. These sensors are all assisted by laser autofocus, a feature that's not present on the Honor 20.  The Honor 20 features one of the best smartphone cameras there are and the combination of the 48MP sensor with the wide-angle lens makes for photography opportunities no matter the lighting conditions. The cameras combined produce beautiful images that feature vibrant colours, amazing night shots that have a lot of detail and portrait shots that look like they have been captured by a DSLR camera. In most circumstances the Honor 20 exceeds expectations but there are one-off instances where colours tend to over saturate and in the process details get washed out.  The handset comes with a dedicated Night mode and images captured with it on are quite stunning as manages to retain the atmosphere without over-enhancing the images. Here, you get photos that are true to life and what's captured is what you see. Photos captured with the handset's macro mode are decent as well but you don't achieve Huawei P30 Pro level performances. This is not to say that the Honor 20 is bad; in fact, it is very good, just not as good as the industry-best P30 Pro.  The 32MP selfie camera that's housed in the punch-hole is pretty great but doesn't match up to the performance of the rear snappers. In well-lit conditions, the camera captured images with a lot of clarity and skin tones looked natural. In low-light situations, the images were slightly grainy but definitely usable for sharing on social media. Shooting images in Portrait mode produced expected results and the edge detection works as advertised.  Battery  The battery is the second area where the Honor 20 lacks in comparison to the Honor 20 Pro. The Honor 20 comes with a 3750mAh battery as opposed to 250mAh more on the 20 Pro. We are not sure about the reason for this disparity as both handsets feature nearly identical dimensions. Maybe the reason for this was segmentation and this was Honor's other way of keeping a distinction between the two handsets.  For what it's worth, the Honor 20 comes with fast charging support as well that can charge the handset up to 50 per cent from a dead state in a mere 24 minutes. This comes in handy as during our testing, with medium usage, it managed to last just about a day. The handset does get a tiny bit heated with excessive usage, but not so much to cause any concern.  Verdict  Priced at Rs 32,999 for the 6GB\/128GB variant, the Honor 20 is a handset that's targeted at the urban jet setters who aren't just content with a boring phone that everyone has. It's targeted at those who don't want to compromise and those who want nothing but the best. The Honor 20 is an unapologetic beast dressed in a beautiful attire that not just stands head-to-head with the competition but punches way above its weight class in terms of raw photography performance.","tags":"smartphone|TAG|mobiles & tabs|TAG|technology|TAG|review|TAG|honor 20","category":"Technology","primary_image_url":"https:\/\/s3.ap-southeast-1.amazonaws.com\/images.asianage.com\/images\/aa-Cover-l8uufh59rr68jaaqhgvht9ld34-20190608175019.Medi.jpeg","primary_image_width":800,"primary_image_height":448,"secondary_image_url":null,"secondary_image_width":0,"secondary_image_height":0,"publisher":"Unavailable","publisher_domain":"Unavailable"}

The latter is most likely the Project Soli Radar system Google has been working on. The other feature is most likely the support for 3D face recognition found on the iPhone X, XR, and XS.  We had the closest possible proof to Google's very own Face ID system when Google employees were recently spotted asking for random people's facial data in exchange for USD 5. The users who agreed were reportedly presented with a large phone and asked to capture their face from different angles.  This makes sense considering the 3D face recognition feature's algorithms need to be trained, and for that Google would need faces, lots of faces.

Rating:  The budget audio accessories market in India is blowing up in a way it hasn't in the last few years with competition getting extremely stiff between all players involved. Transsion Holdings, the China-based tech giant has been creating a sizable impact in India with its various smartphone brands such as Infinix, Tecno and itel. These brands are at the top of their game in the various segments that they cater to. In a bid to disrupt the mobile accessories market, Transsion has introduced oraimo in India and we can't remember a time when a brand has made such a sizable impact in such a short time frame.  Just like its smartphone brands, oraimo caters to every audience out there by launching products at prices that were previously unheard of. After successfully debuting its fitness tracker, oraimo has launched the Studio H66D, a pair of headphones that cater to those who want a great audio experience in a luxurious package without breaking the bank.  I have got the opportunity to spend a few days with the oraimo Studio H66D and these are my unbiased thoughts on them.  Design, Build  When it comes to headphones and it's packaging; Apple-owned Beats set the gold-standard as they proved that the unboxing experience has to be as important as the audio experience. With the oraimo Studios, I felt a similar excitement as these headphones had a packaging that is unlike anything I have seen in this price range; and completely wowed me from the moment I removed its seal.  With the oraimo Studio H66D, Transsion has successfully proved that you don't need to spend a premium for headphones that look great and sound good. Dressed in a premium black with silver accents, these headphones look classy enough for a professional environment as well as cool enough to be used in an informal setting. These cans are built entirely out of plastic which helps in keeping its weight down to a minimum. Due to its lightweight design, I found that using it for extended periods of time was completely doable and I really appreciated this design choice. There are too many headphones available in the market that are heavy that ruin the entire music listening experience. This puts the Studios in a category of its own which I am truly grateful for.  The cushioning on the ears and the band are made of soft faux leather cushioning which makes adds to the comfort levels. Even though these headphones fall under the Rs 3,000 price bracket, oraimo has ensured that the materials used here are of the best possible quality. Being a budget device, the headphones come with a micro-USB charging port and not Type-C. Having a Type-C connector would have made it future-proof but I don't have a real problem with the use of a micro-USB port as this cable is a lot more accessible than the newer standard. The buttons are located on the right side and they are quite responsive and tactile. Usually, with a budget model, there is always the issue of its buttons getting damaged in the long run but oraimo has used some premium rubber over here which should stand the test of time. Also, a neat addition to the Studios is an AUX port which allows you to connect a 3.5mm audio jack if you so need.  Overall, the design and build of the oraimo Studio H66D are much better than expected allowing you to show them off in a crowd as it looks a lot costlier than it actually is.  Performance  The design of the oraimo Studio headphones is as imperative to its performance as is its audio quality. Coming with a lightweight design and soft ear cushions, there is a fair amount of leakage which takes away some of its points as when you turn the volume all the way up, you are disturbing those near to you. Headphones nowadays usually work to rectify this issue but sadly that's not the case with this model.  The Studios feature Bluetooth v4.2 and the brand promises up to 10-metres of range and in my experience, I found it to be more or less accurate. However, it is advisable to not really go beyond this range as you will start to lose connection.  The controls here are pretty easy to navigate around with and each button has multi-functional features as is the case with most earphones and headphones available in the market. The volume up button can be used to switch to the previous song while the volume down button can be used to go to the next song. The power button can also be used to answer\/end a call with just a single click.  When it comes to audio quality, the oraimo Studio doesn't disappoint. The brand states that they offer an audio experience the way the artist intended it to be heard. While the claim is over-extending the truth, it does offer a decent listening experience that's rarely found on headphones in this price range. The bass output produced by the Studios are great and there is a fair amount of separation noticed as well. Mids aren't the greatest here as they tend to be underexposed and drowned out by the bass at certain times. Highs, on the other hand, have clarity that complements the bass and have an amount of sparkle to them. The overall audio quality is great; but at higher volumes, some distortion is observed.  The battery life on the oraimo Studio OEB-H66D is one of the standout features here as it is loaded with a 500mAh battery that offers up to a massive 20-hours of playback and up to a whopping 200-hours of standby time. During my review period, I found this claim to be accurate and thereby making it a great option for anyone who is looking for a pair of long-lasting headphones.  Verdict  The oraimo Studio OEB-H66D is attractively priced at Rs 2,999 and these make for interesting all-in-one headphones. Built with lightweight premium materials, this model is ideal for those who want a classy-looking headphone without the premium price tag. When it comes to audio quality these babies perform as advertised but the best part of them is the stylish design that they feature. Very rarely do we find headphones that sound great, come with a premium finish and priced this attractively; making them a great choice for anyone who is looking to buy a new pair of headphones to complement their stylish lifestyle.","tags":"technology|TAG|oraimo|TAG|gadgets|TAG|headphones|TAG|review|TAG|oraimo studio oeb-h66d","category":"Technology","primary_image_url":"https:\/\/s3.ap-southeast-1.amazonaws.com\/images.asianage.com\/images\/aa-Cover-l8uufh59rr68jaaqhgvht9ld34-20190617160134.jpeg","primary_image_width":400,"primary_image_height":224,"secondary_image_url":null,"secondary_image_width":0,"secondary_image_height":0,"publisher":"Unavailable","publisher_domain":"Unavailable"}

The ASUS 6Z is not your conventional flagship and the design is far from boring. The brand has one intention and one intention only \u2014 to wow the consumer.  Rating:  ASUS has always been a brand that has launched solid products without necessarily standing out from the crowd. Though ASUS has launched some pretty incredible products, they are considered as the brand who 'also ran' and not the one to beat. Last year's ASUS 5Z was a device that did extremely well in reviews the world over and it also came with an incredible design that oozed sex appeal. However, it launched at a time that was too near to the arrival of the OnePlus 6 and the writing was on the wall for ASUS as it was overshadowed by a brand that has been trailblazing in the last few years.  It's 2019 and the entire dynamic of smartphones have changed. What was cool in the summer of 2018 is considered pathetically old tech in 2019. This year, brands aren't afraid to experiment and no longer do consumers want smartphones with tragic old notches or unsightly bezels. This year, brands are experimenting with the design of smartphones by adding cut-outs in the display for punch-hole cameras or going even more extreme with pop-up cameras. Not to be outdone by this onslaught of innovations, ASUS has done something which no other brand has done. ASUS has launched a smartphone with an innovative motorized flip camera that's unlike anything that has been seen before.  The ASUS 6Z main selling point is the amazing flip camera that boasts a 48MP primary sensor which also happens to be its front-facing camera; but that's not all, the handset comes with top-of-the-line specifications such as a large notch free display, a Qualcomm Snapdragon 855 chipset and a very powerful 5000mAh battery.  We spent a few days with the ASUS 6Z and here are our detailed thoughts on one of the most exciting smartphones of the year.  Design, Build  The ASUS 6Z is not your conventional flagship and the design is far from boring. The brand has one intention and one intention only \u2014 to wow the consumer. The ROG phone that was launched last year had its fair share of appeal and it did manage to stir reviews the right way. However, in comparison to the 6Z, it can be classified as being a bit drab and dreary. The ASUS 6Z's price is the differentiating factor here and because of this, the handset is one of the hottest this year. When you combine its motorized flip camera that's not just made for aesthetic appeal but also packs enough of tech, like, motion tracking, an auto panorama and 4K video recording at 60fps, you actually learn to appreciate it a lot more.  The ASUS 6Z has a design that screams no-nonsense and for once it is a good thing. The 2019 smartphone market is absolutely littered with devices that feature glossy gradient finishes and what-not but this handset in all its simplicity stands head-to-head with the best out there. With the 6Z, you get a smartphone that's worn a fancy tailored suit that stands out in a crowd of glossy pretty evening gowns. Because of this, we absolutely love ASUS' design philosophy; and in fact, it looks a lot more premium in comparison to the ASUS 5Z that was a fan favourite.  The handset not just looks great but feels good as well. It has the right amount of weight to make it feel like a premium device; it's something that very few smartphones can claim to possess. The rear is fitted with a curved Gorilla Glass which gives it ample protection against accidental drops. Also, it rests easily in your palm which makes for comfortable handling as you may have guessed due to its curved aluminium sides. Make no mistake, this is a big handset and it's significantly bigger than the recently reviewed Honor 20. Smartphones from the likes of OnePlus and Samsung are paving the way for Android manufacturers with their virtually non-existent bezels and these two brands have excelled in this department. The 6Z however, has a pretty sizable chin in comparison and this is due to the use of an LCD display and not an OLED one that's used by its rivals.  A point to note here is that ASUS has also used a massive 5000mAh battery on the 6Z which is one of the highest capacities found on a flagship smartphone. While the brand has used a massive battery here, they thankfully haven't made it a chunky device. Major ups to ASUS for keeping its weight down to a mere 190g and just 9.2mm at its thickest. This is actually quite an impressive feat as ASUS has also added a motorized flip camera here.  As expected, the 6Z doesn't come with an Ingress Protection certification and this matches up with a lot of handsets with pop-up cameras and it makes ASUS no different. However, there is a sleep plastic case that comes bundled in the packaging which can help protect it against accidental drops.  A feature we loved here is that ASUS has included a 3.5mm headphone jack; a feature which is making a rapid demise, especially on flagship handsets. The one standout was Samsung; however, reports are claiming that the Galaxy Note 10 will lose this much-loved port. This makes ASUS one of the few companies to faithfully embrace this port. This allows you to use your favourite earphones or headphones with it and let's face it; having the old school wired connection is always a win whichever way you look at it.  There is the fingerprint scanner on the rear which actually makes us wonder why ASUS didn't jump on the in-display bandwagon which is being adopted by virtually every Android smartphone manufacturer. Whatever the case is, the scanner is located in a very ergonomic location which allows us to reach it easily. It is also pretty speedy, but not the fastest we have seen, although it gets the job done.  ASUS states that the camera rotates around a 13-gear mechanism and this motorized flip camera is great when you consider the amount of technology ASUS has used to make this all possible. This flip camera is like a little brick that's housed inside a metallic bay and its rotation managed to produce a lot of approval across our office. The motor's sound has a unique sound and this was appreciated by all who heard it as well. Personally, it sounds a bit dated and we would have preferred it if the brand would have kept it simple. A thing that worries us about the camera is that it can be manually extended or placed back in its bay. If someone uses a tad bit extra force, there's a high chance that it could break. ASUS claims that this camera mechanism has been put through sufficient testing but you never quite know.  Moving on, the camera is a pretty speedy affair considering it's not like other pop-up cameras but flips about 180-degrees. While it is fast, it's not fast enough to be used for facial recognition, a feature that's surprisingly a part of the 6Z. We'd much rather stick to the fingerprint sensor for our biometric authentication as it works a lot faster and frankly, it's a lot more convenient.  The ASUS 6Z also comes with a Smart Key above the volume rockers and for people in India, having this feature is very beneficial as a lot of users here are using it to access the virtual assistant to gain valuable information at the touch of a button. Just like a dedicated Google Assistant button, this one also has various features associated with it. What's interesting here is that it can be accessed even if the handset is locked.  Overall, the design and build quality of the smartphone is pretty great and it makes for a fantastic experience.  Display  The ASUS 6Z boasts a beautiful, large 6.4-inch LCD display that dominates the entire face of the device. While the handset has some outstanding features, the all-screen display somehow gets lost in all the wonderful features that are present here. While the massive display is great for watching videos and gaming, you don't get the blacks or colour saturation that's present on smartphones with an OLED display. This 1080 x 2340 IPS LCD display is pretty great though and only if you have a keen eye, will you notice the difference.  In the default setting, the screen has a fair amount of punch and with a wide colour gamut, there was a lot of character to the screen. In the standard setting, the screen featured colours that were rendered accurately and not as vibrant; which we liked a lot. Either way, this display is a great performer and it won't leave anyone wanting more.  The customization options for the display are something which we really appreciate on the ASUS 6Z and it's a feature that has been transferred from its highly successful laptops onto this phone. The hue and saturation can be adjusted as well which makes it a very personalized device.  Brightness levels on the ASUS 6Z are decent and even in direct sunlight, content on the screen is pretty legible. The brightness levels here are rated at 600 nits which is acceptable for a smartphone in today's environment. It doesn't have an overly bright panel; however, viewing content here in most lighting conditions is taken care of.  As stated before, this screen is amazing for videos and gaming and in some respects even better than those with a punch-hole camera cut-out or a notch as it gives you a full-screen view that can't be replicated. Of course, the OnePlus display outranks it but that's because of the 90Hz refresh rate found on the OLED display it uses. Moving on, viewing angles are acceptable here with brightness levels falling off slightly when viewed at an extreme angle. Other than this, we found no other issues with the display.  Software  ASUS traditionally has added a UI that's pretty overwhelming and it contains its fair share of bloatware. The 6Z is unlike anything we have seen from the band before and it comes with an OS that's completely uncluttered and clean; almost like a stock Android OS with just the necessary features that help in making the user's experience a lot better.  If you have used an Android One handset in the past, you will be well acquainted with the OS here and it will provide you with an extremely intuitive experience. ASUS has dubbed this UI as ZenUI 6 and it is based on Android 9 Pie. As mentioned earlier, the look and feel is something similar to what you will experience on a stock Android smartphone and this is the biggest advantage the 6Z has over other smartphones in its price range apart from the OnePlus 7 which also comes with a minimal UI.  The ASUS 6Z has a very clean feel to it and all of the brand's extra apps don't ruin the experience. There is a neat addition here which is found in the apps menu page. On the top right of the screen, you will find three dots that help you to organize your apps into smart groups. There are different options here for you to enjoy the best viewing experience. While we did like this gesture from ASUS, we preferred the option where all the apps were displayed; since we are used to stock Android handsets.  You also get a Game Genie mode which happens to be hidden in the Settings. Also, for first-time users, it appears when you open a game and this allows you with the overall gaming performance. Apart from allowing you to stream your game to Twitch or YouTube, you can use it to block incoming notifications as well. This is handy for anyone who doesn't want to be disturbed during their intense gaming sessions. There is also a lock mode where the navigation keys are locked as well as a lock brightness mode.  Apart from the regular line-up of Google apps, there are also apps from ASUS such as Sound Recorder, a files manager app, and ASUS Data Transfer which is a tool to transfer content from an older device to this one.  Hidden in the settings is a Dark mode and with it, you get an option that's going to be a part of Android Q. In other words, it's great that ASUS has already given you the option to experience a dark theme way ahead of its official release.  Performance  The ASUS 6Z is a powerhouse of a device and it's fitted with an industry-best 7nm Qualcomm Snapdragon 855 chipset. The SoC features a single Kyro 485 core clocked at a whopping 2.84GHz, three Kyro 485 cores clocked at 2.41GHz and four Kyro 485 cores clocked at 1.78GHz. What this basically means is that you get a 64-bit octa-core processor which has been clocked at different speeds which helps in the overall performance of the handset. Paired with this chipset is 6GB or 8GB of LPDDR4 RAM and up to 256GB of storage. In for testing, we received the 6GB\/128 variant which is a pretty solid device and we feel that it's sufficiently capable to handle any tasks thrown at it.  We ran our benchmarks and the ASUS 6Z fared as expected since it comes with the best chipset that's available in the market right now. In certain tests, it even managed to outperform the Honor 20 which comes with a Kirin 980 chipset and that's actually saying something for the performance of Qualcomm's chipset. In the Geekbench test, the ASUS 6Z scored 10582 points in the multi-core test and 3397 points in the single-core test which makes it quite a speedy performer all around.  In terms of media playback, the ASUS 6Z is an absolute pleasure to use and view content on. This is all down to its large screen and punchy colours. Even though the device has an LCD display, the quality of the screen is really good with contrast ranges exceeding expectations. When it comes to gaming, the 128GB is more than sufficient for storing heavy files such as PUBG or Asphalt 9. By using an Adreno 640 GPU that's paired with the Snapdragon 855 processor, we get an extremely powerful handset that rivals the best there is. Graphics rendered well throughout with no framing noticed. Overall, this smartphone can go toe-to-toe with the best and stand tall.  The only issue we faced was a bit of heating. After using the camera for a significant amount of time we observed that the upper area of the handset started heating up so much so that it was noticeable.  Camera  The camera is undoubtedly one of the best features of the ASUS 6Z and its motorized flip mechanism isn't seen on any device in its class. The primary sensor here is a Sony IMX586 48MP lens that's also found on the OnePlus 7 Pro and is considered as the best available. The sensor next to it features a 13MP ultra-wide lens which is becoming a necessity on flagship smartphones these days. The 48MP camera features a \u00bd sensor with a 0.8\u00b5m pixel size. And unfortunately, no OIS which is found on rival handsets with a similar sensor. Autofocus on the AUS 6Z is taken care of by Laser AF, a feature that's seen on the Honor 20 Pro.  The interface of the camera app is pretty easy to navigate around in and you can access different modes by swiping from side to side. In the app, you also have an option for switching between 1.0x or 2.0x digital zoom as well as moving between normal or wide angle shots. At the top of the display, you find the options for settings, HDR, aspect ratio, flash and filters.  The ASUS 6Z has quite a few tricks on offer, especially with the motorized camera. The camera unit doesn't just have two profiles, in fact, the camera can tilt to whatever angle you desire allowing you multiple photography options. The volume rockers can also be used to move the flip-up camera. Like using the on-screen option, the volume buttons can tilt it to the exact angle you desire. Apart from this, the camera app has plenty of settings allowing for a wide variety of shooting options. Not only can you use the 6Z to shoot regular panoramas, but you also benefit from the motorized camera's ability to capture vertical panoramas; a feature that's seldom found on smartphones. This was one feature we were quite enamoured with. Having a 180-degree motorized camera also opens up the possibility of capturing panoramas without actually moving your phone; a feature which we loved on the 6Z. Another feature we really liked on this handset is motion tracking and it follows you if you happen to move all over the frame.  The camera is pretty versatile allowing you to capture images that possess a lot of character no matter the lighting conditions. With these shooters, you can capture images to your heart's content and be sure that no matter what, you will always get a great shot as the HDR+ software handles it all. With the HDR+ at play here, images render accurately even in low-lit environments. If this isn't sufficient for you, there is also the HDR+ Enhanced mode that adds a lot of pop to the image.  Using the 48MP Quad-Bayer is great for daylight photography as it manages to capture a lot of micro details that aren't really noticeable with the 12MP sensor.  Elaborating on the low-light shots, it still does a fine job of capturing images that are bright without possessing a lot of image noise. Low-light photography on the handset is great as the F\/1.79 lens manages to take in a fair amount of light without the loss of much detail. When it comes to wide-angle shots at night, there is some noise noticed but this is us nitpicking and overall, it's very usable for social media and other such apps.  Using the Super Night Mode adds a lot of flair to the otherwise dull images. It manages to capture images with a fair amount of brightness and reducing shadows. The Night Mode is a huge step-up over capturing images in normal mode but not as great as some of those seen from rival handsets.  Selfies with the ASUS 6Z are one of the best we have ever seen on a smartphone as it uses the very same camera to capture selfies. Skin tones appeared accurate and there were a lot of details noticed as well. Using a 48MP camera here, the ASUS 6Z has definitely got to be a contender for the best selfie smartphone in the world. Shooting in Portrait mode is pretty great as well as the edge detection's performance is solid. While it gets the job done pretty well, it's not the best we have seen on a smartphone. The intensity of the blur can be adjusted giving you some pretty artistic shots. Another feature we loved here is the ultra-wide selfie shots. With this feature, you can get a lot more people into the frame and it's excellent for party shots.  Battery  The ASUS 6Z features a 5000mAh battery and this is one of the largest there are on a flagship handset. The battery is rated at two days on a single charge and in our experience; this was just about right. While the battery did not last the full 48-hours, it did manage to last till the end of the second work day; this actually does say something about ASUS' focus on battery life.  The battery also comes with fast charging capabilities; which is a good thing. However, it takes quite a bit of time to top up this massive battery. And during our tests, from a 0 to 100 it took about 2 hours 15 minutes for a complete top-up. Lastly, the handset doesn't come with wireless charging capabilities. However, for this, the price of the device could increase substantially.  Verdict  The one aspect that will draw you to the ASUS 6Z is undoubtedly its motorized flip camera; however, one thing is for sure even though this feature is very enticing, the thing that will get you hooked on this smartphone is virtually all of its other features. The baby comes with all the necessities that make it a flagship and where it loses out in an OLED display and an in-display fingerprint scanner, it more than makes up with a gorgeous LCD panel that can even rival the iPhone XR and that's actually saying a lot.  The ASUS 6Z starts at a competitive price of Rs 31,999 for the 6GB\/64GB variant while the midrange version, the 6GB\/128GB model costs Rs 34,999. The top-of-the-line version, the 8GB\/256GB model undercuts its rivals at Rs 39,999; which by the way is a great price point that the brand has aimed for without any compromises. For this price, theASUS 6Z is an absolute bargain considering you're getting a beautiful device with a powerful Snapdragon 855 SoC and one of the best cameras around. While the hardware is something that will attract you to the phone the software will make you stay. ASUS has successfully walked a fine line here by adding certain elements of its ZenUI in a smartphone that feels a lot like a stock Android and because of this; we find this handset extremely appealing.  If you are looking out for a smartphone that packs enough tech without blowing a hole in your wallet, then the ASUS 6Z is a sure choice for you to consider, no questions asked.","tags":"asus 6z|TAG|mobiles & tabs|TAG|technology|TAG|smartphones|TAG|review","category":"Technology","primary_image_url":"https:\/\/s3.ap-southeast-1.amazonaws.com\/images.asianage.com\/images\/aa-Cover-l8uufh59rr68jaaqhgvht9ld34-20190617165756.Medi.jpeg","primary_image_width":800,"primary_image_height":448,"secondary_image_url":null,"secondary_image_width":0,"secondary_image_height":0,"publisher":"Unavailable","publisher_domain":"Unavailable"}

An average match in the Lite version lasts for about 10 minutes compared to the 25-35 minutes of the original release.  Tencent's popular title Player Unknown's Battle Grounds, or simply put, PUBG, has been a craze since its release last year. The game has now virtually become the face of the Battle Royale genre in countries like India.  Now, the company has launched PUBG Mobile Lite for lower end phones. The game is targeted at budget devices and older devices which are powered by lesser than 2GB of RAM.  The new title will further expand PUBG's growing popularity. Available on the playstore, the game is available for download for roughly 400mb and features a smaller map in gameplay. Instead of the usual 100, the Lite version will put up 60 players at a time to battle against one another, crowning the lone remaining survivor with a 'chicken dinner'.  An average match in the Lite version lasts for about 10 minutes compared to the 25-35 minutes of the original release. This is again, due to the smaller map and lesser number of active players in it.  The game even improves on key features that affect the gameplay on weaker networks like the absence of the bullet-drop effect, no bullet trails and enhanced aim-assist.  Head over to the Google Play Store to try out the game. New users get various rewards like new gears and vehicles.","tags":"pubg mobile|TAG|technology|TAG|in other news|TAG|pubg|TAG|pubg mobile lite","category":"Technology","primary_image_url":"https:\/\/s3.ap-southeast-1.amazonaws.com\/images.asianage.com\/images\/aa-Cover-2umohcm7nicg2nnvj214cvaie0-20180425001922.jpeg","primary_image_width":400,"primary_image_height":224,"secondary_image_url":null,"secondary_image_width":0,"secondary_image_height":0,"publisher":"Unavailable","publisher_domain":"Unavailable"}
