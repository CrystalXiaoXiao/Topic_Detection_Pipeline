# Topic_Detection_Pipeline
The aim of this project was to build a near real-time topic detection pipeline for the news stories published by news sources on the web. If stories are tagged with topics, it becomes easier for the reader to discover them and to follow topics that he/she may be interested in.

Architecture
![Topic Detection Data Pipeline](/bTopicDetectionPipelineArchitecture.png)

A distributed data processing pipeline consists of many moving parts which have to work in unison to make the whole think work. If one of the components fail to work as expected at any time, it creates a ripple effect downstream preventing any further processing. Moreover, debugging a distributed application is not easy. That is why, the architecture and design of the pipeline needs to be carefully thought out. One of those design considerations is choosing the right set of software tools to work with. Fortunately today, there is a lot of great choices available for the job and it helps that many of them are open-source and stable enough to be used by the big technology firms to process terabytes of data on a usual basis.
